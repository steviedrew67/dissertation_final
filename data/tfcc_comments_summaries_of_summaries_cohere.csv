0.0,"I work in a call center. I got a call from a very angry customer. He was screaming at me for about 5 minutes straight. I calmly tried to help him. He then started to swear at me. I politely asked him to stop. He did not. I then told him that I would have to hang up on him. He then said he would call back when he was ready to talk to me like a civilized person. I hope he does. ~ I work in emergency roadside assistance. I drop my customer service voice often. If someone's in an emergency: they need a real person. If someone is rude, or unwilling to listen, or questioning my ability to help them : I drop my tone and my voice and I get more respected for it. Being sugary sweet isn't always the most needed thing in customer service. ~ A man called a call center to complain about his internet speed. He was screaming and swearing at the employee. The employee was polite and professional and tried to help the man. The man didn't like the solutions and started screaming and swearing again. The employee politely told the man that he would have to call back when he was more polite. The man called back and was very polite. ~ I'm sorry to hear that you had to deal with a difficult customer. I'm sure that you did your best to help him, but sometimes people are just unreasonable. I'm glad that your company has taken measures to prevent this from happening again. I'm sure that you will be able to find a new job soon. ~ I'm so sorry you had to listen to that. I would have lost it. I'm not sure if I could have stayed calm like you did. I'm impressed. I've had a few calls like that. One time I had a guy call me a c*** and I just said ""Sir, I'm not going to argue with you. I'm going to transfer you to a supervisor."" I was so proud of myself. ~ I never understand ranting at call centre people. 1. Everyone knows by now you guys have not much power 2. Half the time you possibly hate the company as much as I do in that moment. 3. If Im nice, theres a non zero chance you can actually go outside your real role and get it fixed. So I need you to like me because if my problem is complex Ill probably screw your metrics.",I work in a call center. I got a call from a very angry customer.

1.0,"I used to work for the mental health branch of an insurance company, and people who would call in to check on claims without wanting to give even names and DOBs... it sucked. They'd always say stuff like ""I'm at my office!"" or ""I'm on the subway!"" and I mean... that sucks for you, but why are you calling your insurance company to ask for personal information if you're somewhere you won't even give your name and DOB? And maybe have your insurance card on you when you call in so you can give me that ID number instead of your social, because I'm going to need ONE of those pieces of information. I feel for you. ~ I will always immediately comply with a customer's request to cancel their (free!) membership with us because we didn't give in to their demands. Like come on this is your livelihood here and you wait until the day you move to call? The agent also sent her a email on how to do it online. I don't know any company's that do same day installations.~~I truly hope you never have to deal with a similar call, but if you do, I wonder if it would help when they say, I paid for it with my card! to say, Actually, when you swiped your card, you authorized us to pay for it on your behalf. So far, no money has left any bank account of yours, so you havent paid for anything yet. We are the ones who gave money to the store, and now you need to pay us back. ~ I worked for a credit card call center (I'm in the US) for a bit, and you really get put through the ringer a lot. But there are instances where you get to genuinely improve somebody's day, and those calls do wonderful things for your self worth and mental health. I'm not transferring you to a supervisor as the credit bureau is a separate company. Would be my response. And if they refused to get off the line I would inform a supervisor of the stupid request incase she called back. But then again that depends on management having your back which I assume they don't. ~ I had a mother call me one time to request we send her 20 yr old daughters medical bills in her name not daughters name because she pays all her daughters bills since shes in school. I told her per HIPAA that is not possible because the daughter is a legal adult and once a person turns 18 they are liable for all their finances. Mom LOST it. Told me I sounded stupid and ridiculous. No matter how I spun it she wouldnt budge and asked for a supervisor. Supervisor told her the same things and went round and round with her for an hour! She called back two hours later and the coworker behind me got her and was dealing with her for an hour and transferred to a supervisor. That supervisor shut her down real quick and told point blank per HIPAA it wasnt going to happen and pulled up HIPAA law and read it to her. Mom still wasnt happy. ~ I work general customer service. Today I had the same situation with an account being closed due to 4 months nonpayment. The lady asked me how it was fair if her previous payment history was good. You can have the most impeccable credit in the world, but you stop paying and responding to our communications and you reap what you sew. She was also furious that we couldn't reinstate her account now that she was caught up 5 months later. Apparently we should know better because of her previous history and credit and not treat her like the risk she was. ~ I work for a utility company and People call in where I work all the time the day before or even the day of theyre going to be disconnected. Its like in their mind they think they still have some sort of time to do this but in reality theyre just shooting themselves in the foot for waiting so long. If you want to talk to someone really high up, ask the person on the phone for their email address. Assuming they work for the same company as the COO or CEO, you should have the email format FirstNameLastName@company.com...FirstName.LastName@company.com, FIMILastName@company.com...you get the idea. Then find out the names of the executive staff and email away. Granted their emails are most likely read by admin assistants. My dad has managed to talk to a CEO and a VP of something on two different occasions...The CEO was actually pretty pissed that this was happening with deliveries and ended up getting a fairly expensive piece of furniture for free. FYI: this was after many attempts with customer service and they weren't helpful.",I had a mother call me one time to request we send her 20 yr old daughters medical bills in her name not daughters name because she pays all her daughters bills since shes in school.

2.0,"I had to go back and reread that. You're giving him a delivery in 8 days and he's bitching?!?!?! Considering there's a holiday and a weekend thrown in there, I don't think that's a horrible delivery window at all! Screw em! I bet even if u could deliver tomorrow, he'd bitch about the ring frame ""I won't be home from 11-6, so it has to be before that!!!!"" Some ppl are never happy.~~I do this all the time. I put him on hold and I hear him tell his buddies I just need to get it off the lot. I'm never going to pay for it. I could still give it to him but it would create a huge headache for us, the bank and most seriously, for 
him. ~ I'm sorry you had such a bad day and call OP. I walk people through registering for websites and stuff and I never know what to say when people go ""you must think I'm an idiot huh?"" I'm sorry you had to deal with that and that it made you so upset. It sucks when there isnt really anything you can do to help them and they are being so unreasonable about it. You did a good job with the limited options that you had and the pressure he put you on. Dont let it get to you and dont let it ruin your day. His rudeness is his shortcoming, not yours. You deserve it. ~ I work in a call center. Customers are always mad at me. I don't care. I'm not paid enough for this. ~ I'm sorry you had to deal with that level of entitlement. I used to give out WOW awards to these types of people. It took some doing to earn one and it was usually the same people over and over usually for telling us how to do our jobs despite us being the most experienced and having final say in the process. ~ I feel this on my bones! It seems like prices have risen weekly, or even  daily on some of our parts. Especially since covid hit, and now there's a microchip shortage.... I don't control the pricing. And prices change normally anyways. Add in a volatile market, a global pandemic, and a massive parts shortage.... But if you call and expect the same prices for something you haven't ordered since 2018? Ha. (BTW, not ordering since 2018 is like 5 years in electronics years or something. Its forever. ~ I was ready to order one but then thought my Grandpa who had needed a new TV for some time might in on this too so I called him and he says he needed to talk to Grandma about it first and would call back. What he did instead was call the company to ask for details about that specific model...",OP is a salesperson who sold a TV to a customer. The customer is upset because the TV is now more expensive than what he agreed to pay. He is also upset that OP won't give him a better deal. OP is frustrated because he can't give the customer a better deal and the customer is being unreasonable.
3.0,"I work for a different variety of insurance and deal with this all the time. ""But I set up the policy"" Too bad, not the policy owner, no info for you. ""But I pay for it"" Too bad. ""But I'm their parent"" Nope. ""But I'm the insured"" I. Don't. Care. ~ I once did inbound customer service calls for a phone company. I had a guy call in with enough credits to keep his bill paid for the next three months (dont know who applied them or why), on top of having his last two bills waived through courtesy credits. It was the most excessive abuse of courtesy credits I had ever seen, and the guy wanted more. His reasoning was, and I quote, I am a valued customer and you need to give me those credits to keep my business. At some point, those who work customer service need to have the power to call out problem customers and tell them to their faces that they are a liability costing the company you work for money. ~ I had a manager call recently where this guy (after 45 minutes of me telling him he was in the wrong department for his query) demanded he speak to a manager. He was saying I called myself a manager and all sorts, so when the TM took the call I just sat next to him and he went ""well I've been sat near her for this whole conversation and I haven't once heard her say she's a manager or thst she shouted at you"" lmfao Ended up offline for the rest of the day because it stressed me out so much and was 90 minutes late on my break~~If he had any common sense, he'd see that sending the email while someone's on the phone to maybe figure out why it's not reaching you guys is probably the best option. Nope, it's more important to him to waste your time and harass you. Wish we could normalize simply cancelling these types of ""customers"" and putting them on a list. ~ People are stupid. Sometimes they're so stupid it's funny. Other times it's just sad. Here are some of the best stories. ~ I feel this in my soul. Also I hate the people that think 1. If they give me a police report/case number I can just instantly pull it up and get all of the information from it (I can't, I can order it through LexisNexis which may take up to 8 weeks, or you can get off your lazy ass and go get it from the police yourself)  2. That a police report is the same as a claim somehow (and thus answer ""yes"" when asked if a claim was already started when there wasn't) or 3. That all insurance carriers somehow share a centralized claim system, and a claim number from progressive is just fine to give someone from Geico when asked what their claim number is.",I'm sorry but I'm not going to give you a claim number because you're not the insured. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the policy owner. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who set up the policy. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who pays for the policy. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who called the police. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who filed the claim. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who was in the accident. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who was arrested. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who was cited. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who was charged. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who was convicted. I'm not going to give you the claim number because you're not the person who was sentenced.
4.0,"A woman called a dental office to ask for her husband's dental records. She claimed to be a detective and that the records were needed for an investigation. The dental office asked for a subpoena before releasing the records. The woman became angry and hung up. She called back and spoke to another employee who released the records. The woman called back a third time and spoke to yet another employee. The woman was angry that the employees would not just give her the records. She threatened to call the police and have the employees arrested for not giving her the records. The employees called the police. The woman was arrested for threatening the employees. ~ I'm a CSR handling all kinds of tickets but mostly incidents. They also say "" it does not work, just fix it"". Sometimes they think they know how everything works but they don't. I can soak up alot from my clients but if they start questioning my expertise i can get snappy. I book appointments sometimes too and people are crazy. We do phone appointments and people want in person appointments or after banking hours (evenings and weekends) or they don't want their appointment with their assigned manager because they're not white or ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH. (Sometimes they out right say that and I can refuse to book but sometimes it's passive aggressive and if they don't out right say anything we can't refuse). I once got a guy who didn't want a daytime appointment but booked it anyway to ""waste your time like you're wasting mine"" and was rather annoyed when no one called him and we sent more reminders to him. ~ I'm a pharmacy tech and I have to say that I'm not surprised by any of these stories. I've had people yell at me for things that are not my fault. I had a lady call and yell at me because she couldn't get the cheese-be-gone she wanted.

During the BLM thing she had to tell a customer she had only spoken to over the phone, they wouldn't be giving him a loan. My job is actually bilingual, so I do speak French regularly and fluently BUT it is not my first language. If I make even the slightest mistake (""le rue"" instead of ""la rue"" for example) people will either mock me, switch to English and refuse to speak French again or continue speaking French and just correct me in the rudest way possible. One of my first French calls here, I was so nervous I stuttered a lot (nerves make my language skills go bye bye). My supervisor pulled me into her office, slammed the door behind me and asked if I really did speak French or if I just pretended for the interview."
9.0,"I was in retail for a decade. I was in a call center role for 9 months, then got promoted to a department that dealt with the angriest of the angry customers (the ones asking for the CEO) for 2 1/2 years. Went for a training department role where I am now. I dont even have a work extension. Never will talk to a customer again. The past year has been the happiest of my life. ~ I've been in a call centre for 5 years. I cry before I clock in. I cry between calls. I cry after I clock out. I'm looking for a new job. I don't want to be a call centre worker anymore. ~ I worked customer service in a call centre and I loved the job. I loved being able to help people, to sort out their issues and calm people down. Many of my colleagues had worked there for years. We had a high turnover of staff but the core always remained. Hang in there. The Holidays are always the hardest being in a call center. Its always stressful for people so they lash out. No customers or stats to worry about. ~ I've been in call centres for 13 years. I'm now looking to get out. I'm currently on £10.50ph, with no prospect of a pay rise. I'm working 60hrs a week, and have been for the last 6 months. I'm working 10pm-8am, 4 days on, 3 days off. I'm not sleeping properly, and am constantly stressed. I'm not getting any time to myself, and am struggling to find the energy to do anything in my spare time. I'm seeing a counsellor to try and help with my depression. I'm looking for a new job, but it's hard to find something that pays as well as this one. I'm also looking at going back to university. ~ I'm about to start a new job as a supervisor in a call center. I've never been a supervisor before and I'm worried about the stress of dealing with angry customers all day. I've heard horror stories about supervisors getting screamed at and being verbally abused by customers. I'm also worried about the monotony of the job. I've heard that supervisors have to deal with a lot of paperwork and have to micromanage their employees. I'm also worried about the low pay. I've heard that supervisors barely make any more than their employees. I'm also worried about the attrition rate. I've heard that supervisors have to deal with a lot of turnover. ~ I got started in a call center in 2017, I was dialing at a  broker for a car insurance company, I sucked at the dialing job and got fired after 2 months and went to another call center selling accidental disability Cover, got fired there too   cycle continued until I end up in client services. I think the best thing you can do is try to channel that frustration into motivation. When you get off work try to really focus on those certs, or something else that interests you. Now that you are gaining customer service experience it wont take much to get into an entry level helpdesk position. The sooner you focus on that and get it out of the way the sooner you can leave this miserable job behind.

There are no rooms to book Them - What if I go to the front desk? Me - They'll tell you the same thing. There are no rooms available. I can book you one of our other hotels nearby instead Them - No I wanted X.

Once the injunction has been filed you can fight them on it. ~ A's friend called to book a reservation for a hotel room. A's friend was confused about the total price of the room, so A's friend called the call center to clarify. A's friend was then put on hold for a few minutes.
