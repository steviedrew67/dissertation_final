0.0,"I work in a call center. Yesterday, I had a caller who was extremely irate. He called back 5 minutes later, and then 5 minutes later again. On the third call, he threatened to go to the CEO and get me fired. They pulled the calls, and heard what he said. He had the wrong number the entire time. Me: Can I get your full address please? Caller: [says p.o. box]. Me: I need your home address please. Caller: [repeats p.o. box]. Me: Mam I need your home address. Caller: [repeats p.o. box again indignantly]. God didn't you hear me the first two times. Caller: [realizes how ridiculous she sounds] Oh my god I can't believe I just said that three times. You must think I'm an idiot.~~I worked in a call center for a new online bank. A man called in to sort out something on his bank account. I fixed it for him no problem. Then, he asked if he could do the same thing on his wife's account. The man was frustrated, but eventually gave in. I started to sign off, happy to get to lunch on time, when suddenly, I was interrupted... A customer called at almost midnight, obviously drunk, and irate about the fact that his golden oldies movie channel was saying he was not subscribed.~~Call centre workers have been sharing their most bizarre experiences on Reddit. One user, who works in technical support, was asked by a caller whether she was wearing anything big stud. Another said he was mistaken for a man over the phone. A woman working at a call centre was asked for her number by a stranger who knew her location.~~I'm a people pleaser. I don't like being confrontational. I said I'm trying to help you, please do not speak to me like that and he actually stopped and apologized. I think he felt bad because he ended up hanging up a few seconds later. I'm proud of myself.~~Call centers are the pits of the service industry. The pay is low, the hours are long, and the customers are, well, customers. But sometimes, customers can be so ridiculous that they make your day. Here are some of the funniest stories from call center workers.~~I'm not a fan of customer service. I'm not a fan of sales.

Here are some of the funniest stories from call center workers."
1.0,"A customer wanted a replacement card as the one he had was due to expire in a few weeks. I couldn't reissue the card unless it was lost, stolen or damaged. The customer eventually admitted that the card was in fact damaged. A former bank customer service representative (CSR) on Reddit shared a story about a couple who were on their honeymoon and couldn't use their credit card. When the CSR looked into the issue, she discovered the husband had unpaid child support. The wife was unaware of the lien and was not listed on the account. The husband was enraged and began yelling at the CSR. The husband became quiet.~~A collection of funny, sad, and just plain WTF moments from people who work in customer service. From banks to credit card companies to government offices, these workers have heard it all. And they're sharing their stories.~~A woman called today who was a new customer credit card opened only two weeks ago. She immediately tried to make a purchase for a few thousand dollars. She gets declined because it's high risk and she has no spending history. Someone calls, is super fishy ( marker suspicious caller)and can't pass basic security. Today she calls me to ask why she's getting declined. It was her husband that called in not her. Don't lie, we can smell bullshit a mile away.~~A customer calls in because her debit card has been closed due to fraud. I explain that once a card is closed it cannot be reopened. She threatens to sue us for child support after the baby is born. A call centre worker has shared the ridiculous exchange he had with a customer who was having trouble accessing her monthly statement. The customer became increasingly irate and demanded to speak to the call centre worker's supervisor. A former banker has shared a hilarious call he had with a customer who was confused about her bank balance. The woman called the bank believing she had been the victim of fraud. However, after going through the transactions the banker discovered the woman had spent almost all of the money she had received from a settlement. The woman became increasingly angry as the banker explained the charges. She refused to listen to reason and the banker was forced to end the call.~~I work in a call centre. This means that we can no longer take card payments over the phone as the customer has to type in their card details. Today I spoke to an accountant who was furious that I could not take his card payment over the phone. He was also angry that I could not put him through to a manager as he is an accountant and knows what is acceptable.~~I work in a call center. Me and a coworker of mine have had this recent trend of people calling in and saying ""why am i behind? i cancelled the card!"" and you go back and check, because hey, maybe something went fucky. turns out, they cancelled the card while carrying a huge balance.

2.0,"A customer service rep has shared the racist abuse she received from a customer on the job. The customer service rep, who has not been named, was trying to help a customer who had not received their order. After asking the customer to hold while she checked with her supervisor, the customer became abusive, using racist language. The customer service rep then disconnected the call and flagged the account for fraud. The incident has caused a Twitter storm, with many people expressing their support for the customer service rep and condemning the customer's racist language.~~I work in customer service. I deal with angry people all the time. I used to work in a call center for a cosmetics company. There was one customer who would call up every so often and say she was interested in placing an order. I'd ask her what she would like, and she'd say, ""I'm not sure, tell me what you have!"" She'd inevitably end up spending several hundred dollars on a variety of products, none of which she had decided on in advance of calling. I often wondered why she preferred having everything pitched to her like that rather than browsing our online catalogue at her own pace before calling to place her order, but it sure beat getting yelled at by Susan from Louisiana who ordered bath melts in July with ground shipping and thought they'd arrive in solid form, so I never complained.~~We have a repeat customer who is known for being a special snowflake (referred to as ss from this point).

He then wondered why he hadn't received anything for a while.~~I worked at a call center that got contracts from various large companies to work as their customer service for them.

But they're also a place of work for many people. And sometimes, the people who call in are just as ridiculous as the people who work there. These are some of the funniest call center stories.~~I worked in a call center in the late 90s. Customer calls up and places an order. We go through billing address, shipping address, get to the credit card and all of a sudden I'm hearing the customer pushing buttons on their phone. I wait for it to stop, and say 'ms customer, sorry, we had some interference on the phone, I'll take the credit card number now'. More beeping. Finally it clicks.

For the first 3 months it was hard but I was getting bonus half the time. It all started to go wrong about 3 months ago when I got moved into a new team. My manager told them off when she saw I was upset. Then it got worse, they started throwing things at me. My manager does nothing. I slammed my fist on the desk and said that's enough.~~Call center workers have been sharing their experiences of working in the industry.

I take 80-100 calls a day, and at least 60 of them are angry, abusive, and just downright unpleasant. I've stopped doing my schoolwork, I've started smoking again, and I can't use the phone when I get home because even just ordering pizza gives me anxiety. Same for my friends.~~I work in a call center. I've been here for two years. I started in customer service and now I handle credit card applications for retail workers. The management is terrible. I transferred to this department after being in customer service for a year and now I handle credit card applications and deal with retail workers and it's like every single call is me being screamed at along with management despising me. I've applied for 10 other departments and customer service was hard but at least I had supportive managers who helped me every step of the way this is just getting ridiculous.~~I cannot stand going into work anymore.

I can't sleep at night because I just think about how I have to wake up and do the same thing tomorrow. I wake up every morning nauseous and sometimes I even throw up from anxiety. It's made me depressed. I don't want to do anything when I get off work or on weekends. It's the same thing just a different day, getting yelled at by assholes over things I can't control and then also getting bitched at by my manager for stats not being perfect or because I sounded like a robot with no emotions during my call.

He gives me his dates and details. We get to the email address, and the following conversation ensues.~~A frequent flyer calls United Airlines to book a flight. She wants to speak to a supervisor, but the customer service agent refuses. The customer is put through to the VIP customers line. A new EU law, set to be introduced in 2018, will mean that airlines will have to pay out up to ‚Ç¨600 (¬£534) in compensation to passengers for long delays. However, some airlines are concerned that the law could open the floodgates to claims from passengers who are merely looking for a free flight. Ryanair has already changed its terms and conditions in order to shorten the time limit for claiming compensation. easyJet, meanwhile, has called for the law to be changed so that claims can be processed through the airline, rather than via a claims management company.~~I work for an airline.
