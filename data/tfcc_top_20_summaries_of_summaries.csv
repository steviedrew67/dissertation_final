But that's slow. I was a lot faster before my 12-month paternity leave.” His colleagues listened in to the exchange and were amused by the customer’s stunned silence.~~The similar-sounding German words for ""death,"" ""angel,"" and ""devil"" can lead to comical mix-ups in real-life situations.

The call centre worker gave the abusive customer two options - either put up with the service not working or allow her to do her job.  The customer confirmed his identity and the worker fixed the problem before calling the customer a ""twat"".

The company did not discipline her, but suggested she should just hang up in future instead of teasing the customer.~~A caller named ""Michael"" had trouble accessing a medical claim website, but successfully passed security measures despite giving a DOB inconsistent with the account's age.

She thinks about him often and hopes that someone was there for him in the end.~~An unknown caller repeatedly makes abusive calls, leaving a string of expletives and occasional bomb threats, but hangs up before anyone can speak.

When the customer service representative complied, they were immediately snapped at for not addressing the customer properly.

It's unclear why the customer was upset in the first place, but the representative admits they may have let their annoyance show.~~Despite using the same greeting multiple times a day and sounding professional, a customer service representative is often mistaken for an automated system.

However, the customer did not find it amusing.~~During a troubleshooting call with a customer and his wife, the author experienced a humorous exchange. When asked about COVID-19, the author read a script, and the customer responded with ""yeah yeah yeah"", causing the author to speed up.

The call center agent thinks of the incident as karma, an outcome that gives him comfort despite the horrifying nature of the call. The text highlights how hostile customers can be, even when a call center agent attempts to help.~~Mute buttons prove useful when dealing with tough customer service situations. It's even more advantageous when the customers don't realize the representative can still hear them. Customers often rant and reveal their concerns while muted, allowing the representative to gain insight into their queries. In one instance, a representative overheard a female customer arguing with her boyfriend about child support before returning to a sweet demeanor once the mute was off. Despite the hidden entertainment factor, mute buttons prove valuable in gaining a better understanding of customer disputes.~~A former technical support worker at a government-funded insurance agency working on a website encountered a customer who only spoke to female call centre agents with high-pitched voices.

During a call with the customer, he threatened to shoot up the agency but after failing to complete his objective on the website the employee hung up.

They feel that this approach is effective and wishes their colleagues would follow suit.~~The author used to work at an American bank and received a call from a customer who asked where the call center was located. After being told it was in Nicaragua, the customer swore and demanded to speak to an American supervisor. The author put the customer on hold and informed an escalations agent, who hesitated to take the call as they had grown up on a farm in Kansas.~~A customer service representative was insulted by a customer who bragged about his high IQ and made thinly veiled jabs throughout their conversation.

The rep jokingly suggests bringing back words like ""poindexter"" and ""nincompoop"".~~The author expresses frustration with customers who refuse to accept that their request cannot be granted, even after being given a clear explanation.

The writer also noted that elderly callers' expectations of assistance were unreasonable.~~A customer is angry because a manager did not call him back after he was informed that the warranty does not cover his damaged television.

The caller sarcastically told the author that the current date was the 10th and two days ago was the 8th. The author asked the caller to read out the format of the date and realized that it was entered incorrectly, as it was formatted as 08/01/2019, or August 1st, instead of January 8th. The author stayed silent until the caller realized his mistake and apologized for his tone.~~A cruise ship call centre worker describes how most of their calls involve dealing with elderly technophobes or difficult travel agents, and they try to keep the calls short to meet their targets. However, they recently had a call with a man in his 30s who struggled to focus and frequently got confused. Despite the call being over an hour long, the worker enjoyed it and their conversation led to the booking of two holidays. The man was grateful and jokingly referred to the worker as his best friend.

One worker dealt with a sweet old man who was lonely, but later found out he passed away. Another dealt with a drunk and abusive customer who crashed his car mid-call. One worker overheard a customer arguing about child support while on mute.

The customer insisted that the old way of providing card number and digits was better and accused the company of making it impossible to pay his bill. However, the company has multiple payment options including online payment and payment in stores. The customer's job as an accountant was irrelevant but he still insisted on speaking to a senior manager.~~Zelle transfers can only be made instantly through a connected debit card. A customer's transfer was not going instantly because their debit card wasn't connected to the account they were using for Zelle. Although the customer had a debit card for the account, it wasn't activated. After attempting to activate the existing debit card, the customer realized that they needed to order a new one. The customer service representative was surprised by the number of people who argue instead of listening to the solution.~~A customer at a bank asks the customer service representative to sign a legal form from the US government on their behalf to remove a levy from their account.

When a customer complains about two unauthorized transactions, the author investigates and discovers that the transactions were attempted through a third-party app that the customer had installed.

They use a sophisticated service to run customers' names and phone numbers and pick out fraudsters. When they have identified fraudulent activity, they mark the record accordingly.

A panic hoarder was upset because they had to place 11 separate orders to get enough items, with each order incurring a $5.99 shipping charge.

The hoarder finally understood the reasoning of the policy.~~Despite their fair share of rude callers, an employee discovers they remembered a caller's name, and pleasantly speaks to them.

The author offered to send the cleaning product for free and suggested borrowing a container from friends.

The agent expressed a smug sense of entitlement after the conversation and noted the possible impersonation attempt.~~Due to feedback, the author will post less content where pets may be harmed, and for a lighter topic, discusses why modified cars are considered a high insurance risk. In the UK, all vehicles must carry at least third-party liability insurance in case of an accident. Insurers judge drivers' risk profiles and base the cost of insurance accordingly.

She hung up in disgust, furious I had not interrupted her earlier.~~Many insurance companies offer cover if a pet gets lost and the owner incurs expenses recovering them, such as printing leaflets. However, a handwritten receipt for the cost of printing them is insufficient, and a professionally printed receipt is required.

A member grievance was filed to help the customer with the $1200 bill that could have been avoided had the dentist office called.~~A customer requesting to add a person to his insurance was told that a new insurance certificate must also be sent to the registered address, which the customer wanted to avoid as he did not want his wife to find out about the change.

The incident occurred before paperless certificates were introduced.~~A rental car company's employee recalled an incident where a customer had taken a car abroad without informing the company and subsequently crashed it into a toll booth at a high speed, injuring his children who were not wearing seatbelts.

The company refused and legal action was taken against the customer for reckless driving, child endangerment, and causing damages. The employee advises renters to read terms and conditions and use common sense.~~A former employee of an auto glass claim center recalls the training he received involving role-play claims. The employee was instructed to be creative with the claims, so he broke his “motor home’s” windshield by hitting a golf ball too hard while practicing his swing. A year later, the former employee received a call from a man who had actually broken his windshield in his motor home in the same way. The two had a laugh about the coincidence during lunch with a colleague.~~A call center employee for a large life insurance company in the UK recounted a recent call where a customer threatened to cancel their policy as they did not realize that they would not receive any money back if they did not die before the policy expired. The employee tried to explain that it was an insurance policy only and that it pays out if the policyholder dies. The call demonstrates that there is still confusion among people when it comes to life insurance policies.~~An insurance agent received a call from a customer concerned with the increase in her renewal offer premium.

The agent informed the customer that this was considered a significant collision, and that it would likely affect her rates regardless of the insurer. The conversation concluded with the customer declaring it was wrong and hanging up.~~A customer called to complain about not receiving her insurance discount for removing her mother from her policy. After realizing that her mother did, in fact, have her own policy and the customer's policy was not updated accordingly, the customer demanded that the issue be corrected. The agent complied by backdating the correction to the date when the other policy was bound. The customer was thrilled until she learned that the backdated correction resulted in an increased billing. The agent suggests that if the customer had been quiet about the issue, she would have saved money.~~A man called an auto/motorcycle insurance company regarding his motorcycle policy. Despite scheduling a payment for the day of cancellation, the policy would still be cancelled.

However, he later realizes that his phone is indestructible and he has a good case for it. When he tries to hang up, he can't due to a broken screen. The author politely releases the call for him.~~In car insurance, an agent was unable to quote a vehicle due to its high value but was repeatedly asked if removing young drivers would make a difference. The agent clarified that the issue was related to the car's worth, not the age of the drivers. Despite explaining this multiple times, it took about ten minutes for the customer to understand.~~An agency manager for an insurance company takes over a phone call from a phone staff member after the client can't be found on their system.

The client did not realize she'd used her married name on her policy even though she'd been married for 15 years.~~An auto insurance worker received a call from a customer who wanted to replace a 2015 BMW on their policy with a 2018 Camry, resulting in lower insurance costs. However, when the worker explained the price difference, the customer interrupted and became outraged at having to pay anything at all. It frustrates the worker when customers with a history of accidents and tickets complain about paying high premiums, as the cost far outweighs what they are paying. The worker suggests driving safer to lower insurance costs.~~While working in insurance sales and service, the author decided to sit in on a claims call. The customer reported that their phone screen became unusable after their son dropped it on the way to school that morning. However, the claims handler could not locate the policy number in the system and placed the customer on hold to contact the servicing handler.

3.0,"A customer service representative for auto and motorcycle insurance explains to a caller that she cannot release information on her cousin's policy without her cousin's consent. The caller argues that the information is not sensitive and does not violate HIPAA, but the representative explains that the company's security and privacy act prevents her from giving out the information. The caller hangs up, frustrated and threatening to look for other insurance options.~~The author works in an insurance call center handling complex technical calls, escalations and some cursory underwriting calls. Most callers are people with enough dedication to call an insurance company at 2 a.m. to complain about their bills, but not always enough money to pay them. The author tells of a difficult call from a woman who claimed to have power of attorney for her 100-year-old war veteran uncle whose balance had gone to collections. The author could not discuss much with her because there was no poa on file. The caller threatened to complain on social media and claimed she had already gone to the insurance commissioner in her state.~~A policyholder called for an update on their insurance claim and asked for the agent's name. The agent provided their first name and the policyholder asked for their surname, which was Seabridge. The policyholder then made a joke, saying ""Oh, well don't go jumping off and committing suicide."" The agent was shocked and uncomfortable but tried to shrug it off. At the end of the call, the policyholder said ""bye, and don't kill yourself"" before hanging up.~~The text describes the frustration of an insurance company representative dealing with entitled customers demanding higher refunds for the COVID-19 crisis. The representative recounts a call with a customer who was not eligible for the refund due to having cancelled their policy before the cutoff date. The customer became verbally abusive when they were informed of this fact, with the representative offering to set up a payment plan if the last payment caused financial hardship. The call ended with the customer cursing at the representative and hanging up.~~An investment/insurance call center worker encountered a difficult customer who was unhappy that the worker could not provide payment information for her adult children's plans despite her payment for them. The worker explained that this was due to confidentiality and legal policies, and that other companies would have similar regulations. The customer accused the worker of not giving her enough notice of changes, despite multiple reminders, and threatened to take her business elsewhere. The worker eventually hung up on the customer, who wished them a bad day – a sentiment returned in kind by the worker.~~The author works in an insurance call center as an underwriter and recently moved from phones to chat. The author encountered an agent who was having trouble submitting a quote due to incomplete payment. The author directed the agent to complete the payment in the normal system and provided a link with clear directions. The agent refused to read the instructions and asked the author to explain it to him. The author laughed and submitted the quote for the agent, who eventually completed the payment the way he was used to doing it. The author comments on the irony of the situation- the agent didn't want to read instructions, but was chatting with someone for help.~~An insured customer called to complain that a previous call was disconnected by a CSR when they put her on hold for ten minutes. She wanted to get into her pajamas for comfort during the call and believed the CSR should have waited longer as she had informed them it would take a while. The representative had to remind the customer that she made the decision to call without her pajamas and that her policy contract requires cooperation during the investigation. The customer found this irrelevant, and the representative suggested making verification calls about wearing pajamas.~~An insurance call center agent describes a call from a customer who requests that his policy be reinstated, despite it being cancelled eight months prior for failing to complete necessary verification tasks. The customer claims he did not receive notifications via email or USPS because he believes aliens are tracking him. He even claims to have been abducted by aliens and probed. The agent informs him that his request cannot be granted, but the customer remains calm and understanding, attributing the situation to the aliens' control over government entities.~~A car insurance worker discusses their company's smart box policies that reward good driving and impose fees for poor driving every 90 days. A customer inquired about the dangerous times affecting his son's policy due to his new job, but the worker explains that it is part of the agreed-upon terms and cannot be changed. After a manager reinforces the policy, the customer threatens to contact his solicitor and MP, but the worker imagines the futility of their efforts against an agreed-upon policy.~~An auto/motorcycle insurance provider received a call from a customer whose policy was pending cancellation due to a missed payment, and the auto payment system was unable to retrieve the payment. The system would then require payment to be made by a certain date, or the policy would be cancelled. However, the customer refused to pay the missed payment and was offended by the notion of cancelling her policy over one missed payment. The customer told the provider to cancel the policy and that they would take their business elsewhere.~~A customer called to renew their car insurance policy and was quoted an annual rate of $1670, which was $147 a month. The customer had previously paid $100 for one month because they switched from their old car to their new car with one month left in the term. The customer insisted that a previous broker had told them they could get the policy for $100 a month and was advised to go to that broker as $1670 a year cannot be made into $100 a month.~~Insurance is meant to cover unexpected losses, but people are capable of making stupid decisions. When a customer threw a party and caused significant damage to his home while he was away, the insurance company refused to cover the claim, arguing that he had failed to show reasonable judgment. The customer claimed that he had left his home in the care of a friend, but when asked how long he had known him, he admitted that he had only just met him at the party. As a result, the claim was declined.~~The author, working at an insurance company call center, was asked by a customer to speak with their supervisor. When the author asked for their information, the customer refused and insisted on speaking to the supervisor.

Upon investigation, the policy is found to have lapsed due to the customer's mother halting payments five months after taking the policy out. The customer becomes angry and accuses the company of being scammers, but privacy laws prevent the call center worker from responding publicly. The story highlights the importance of understanding insurance products and ensuring premiums are paid to avoid disappointment.~~A pet insurance caller was incensed when her premium increased after moving house. She accused the insurance company of punishing her for other people having sick pets. The company explained that just like car insurance premiums, pet insurance premiums vary by location and can go up or down depending on vet prices and claims in the area. Despite her work in insurance, the caller still found this concept nonsensical and threatened to report the company to the department of insurance before hanging up.~~Insurance company customer service representatives often deal with rated location fraud or rate jumping. This happens when customers misrepresent where their car is kept in order to pay a lower insurance rate. However, it’s not the job of customer service staff to decide whether a customer is lying or not. Rick, a former sales agent, got a call from someone who was being shifty and wanted cheaper rates by providing different city locations. Rick quoted a policy for each location and the customer failed to get coverage in the more price-friendly location. This meant the insurance company wouldn't insure him at all.~~A customer argued with an insurance company representative because he needed to send in writing a request to cancel his policy, instead of being able to do it by phone. The customer claimed it was an inconvenience, but it would have taken less time to write the letter than arguing about it. In the end, the customer found the suggestion to write the letter himself to be impertinent and hung up the phone.~~Working in an insurance call centre, the writer handles escalated calls and technical issues every day. One call, in particular, intrigued her. A vendor rep had been on the phone talking to a customer for an hour before the call was escalated. The customer wanted to know if insurance followed the vehicle or the driver. It turned out that his wife was excluded from coverage, but he wanted a simple answer to a complex issue. When he used Jeff Bezos as an example, the writer was stunned. The customer then asked if every person on the planet would need an exclusion form before driving his Toyota Tercel.~~A woman called to cancel pet insurance she agreed to for a year, but the insurance provider required her to pay for the full year as per the agreement she signed. She then called the credit card agent to help her cancel by removing her card from them, but the agent informed her that they are only a form of payment and cannot cancel the insurance. The agent advised against signing an agreement if unable to afford it and recommended finding a way to manage the situation.~~A man called an insurance company angry that they couldn't access his estranged wife's policy with another company, which put both his and her insurance in jeopardy. He was rude, dismissive and irrational. It later emerged he had a no-contact order against him and had been arrested five years earlier for trying to solicit sexual favors from a child aged between 14 and 17.~~An employee of a large auto insurer's call center received an email informing them that some agents were randomly selected to receive a certificate that allowed them to throw out a graded call. The employee believes this is unfair because employee raises and job security are determined by graded calls, and some employees may be fired for receiving a non A-level grade on one call while others are randomly given the chance for a do-over. The employee, who is not in danger of losing their job, still finds the situation unjust.~~An insurance employee faced an uncomfortable situation when a customer with a history of making talking too much revealed that her dog was a pit bull with a history of aggression towards people and cats. Guidelines in the insurance industry suggest that pit bulls are not covered. The bartender had to cancel the customer's coverage as she broke underwriting guidelines on having a dog with a history of aggression. The employee said that the customer kept making things worse for herself. The writer of the article does not agree with the insurance industry's dog breed guidelines, but understands why they exist.","“I know the information I’m asking for doesn’t violate HIPAA!”~~You Can Go Ahead and Threaten to Sue, But I Still Cannot Discuss This With You~~""Don't kill yourself""~~Why aren't you giving me money?~~""I hope you have a horrible day.""~~I don't want to read~~""I asked her to wait!""~~When Between-Call Reading Tries to Come to Life~~Change the T&amp;CS or I will get Parliament involved!~~“I can’t believe I’m being treated like this!”~~There is no way $1670 a year is $100 a month~~No, insurance doesn’t cover you when you are a complete muppet.~~THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS A KING!~~Your Company is Nothing but a Scam!~~“I work in insurance, but I don’t understand this basic insurance concept!”~~When lying to us bites you you-know-where...~~I am impertinent!~~The Crazy Just Keeps Getting Crazier~~What part of ""we are not a form of cancellation"" can people not understand~~The most vile, disgusting man called me today~~No about the customer, but a BS ""prize"" my company is offering.~~Just Stop Talking.","The article discusses various experiences of workers in insurance call centers. One worker had to refuse a customer's request for information on her cousin's policy without consent. Another call involved a difficult conversation with a woman who claimed power of attorney for her uncle, but had no official documentation. A different caller made inappropriate suicide jokes towards an agent. A customer became verbally abusive towards a representative regarding refunds for COVID-19, despite being ineligible for them. In another call, a customer accused an agent of not providing adequate notice on confidentiality policies for her adult children's plans. The author of the article encountered an impatient agent who refused to read instructions for submitting a quote. Similarly, a customer threatened to take her business elsewhere when she was informed of her policy's pending cancellation due to an unpaid bill.

3.0,"A call center worker at a health insurance company in France received an angry call from a woman named Karen who was unable to find her guarantees on the company's website. The worker searched the database and asked their manager for help, but Karen became increasingly agitated, threatening to sue if she got into an accident due to not having her glasses. The worker passed Karen to their manager who dealt with the call calmly, assuring her that her request would be taken care of after her lunch break. Karen eventually received the information that day, and the worker praised their manager for handling the situation well.~~An insurance agent tells a story of a customer who attempted to make a claim for a pair of hairdressing scissors the day after taking out insurance. The agent explains that customers cannot claim for items that were damaged before a policy was purchased, leading to the customer becoming irate and demanding a refund. The customer called back later to have the same conversation with the agent again, not realising they were speaking to the same person.~~An insurance client on a 4 payment plan missed a payment then cancelled the policy. He expected a large refund but was informed it would only be a small amount due to the structure of the payment plan. The client was confused and asked why he wasn't receiving a large sum, and the insurer was forced to explain multiple times that he wasn't entitled to a refund for a payment he never made.~~As an insurance agent working in a call center, the author often had to transfer calls to different locations. One day, when attempting to transfer a call for a specific policy type, the person on the other end refused to accept the transfer and insisted on scheduling a callback. The author explained that they were a colleague, not a customer, and had a customer waiting on hold. Despite this, the person still refused to accept the transfer and the author had to schedule a callback for their customer.~~A car insurance claims call center worker recalls an incident that occurred about 15 years ago, before Google Maps became prevalent. A policyholder phoned to make a claim but had no replacement transportation, and requested a free hire car as she was unable to get into town and do her shopping. The call center worker refused the request, instead advising her to stand outside the Beacon Pub and wait for the number 23 every ten minutes. This resulted in no hire car being given, which was ultimately the policyholder's responsibility to secure.~~The author was promoted to a senior representative position but feels that no clear expectations or goals were set. The author handled a call with an irate customer who wanted a refund immediately, but the company's policy required a 10-day hold on refunds for payments made out of checking accounts. The customer gave the author a bad survey, and the author's manager brought it up during a scheduled coaching session, spending 20 minutes berating the author and suggesting that they should have used more creative solutions. The author felt belittled and incompetent, and the manager could have handled the situation better.~~An insurance worker catering to the elderly had to deal with an uncooperative client nicknamed ""the raptor"" who became angry when asked for personal information regarding a potential car accident. The worker had trouble getting any useful information from the raptor who claimed there was no accident and refused to accept knowledge of liability deductibles. The situation escalated into a shouting match with the worker questioning the raptor's claims of visiting their adjusters office.~~The customer calls an Australian health insurance company and speaks to Jayhow90. The customer, Bruce Nicecustomer, provides their policy number, personal information, and claim number. Jayhow90 checks the notes and informs Bruce that their claim has been approved and a further benefit of $174 has been paid to their account that morning. Bruce thanks Jayhow90 and the call ends on a positive note. Jayhow90 praises customers who provide their information promptly and treat them with respect.~~The writer, a licensed insurance sales agent, often finds their job okay. However, the recent story of a woman who cannot afford the extra $40 added to her policy due to a previously unreported accident made the writer feel terrible. The customer had no idea that the accident had been reported, which was verified by the claims agent, and she could not afford the increase due to her financial situation. The writer felt sympathetic towards the customer's situation and wished they could have helped her, but wasn't allowed to tell her to find insurance elsewhere.~~The policyholder called an auto insurance call center to remove coverage from a car he had sold but kept the plates for. The call center representative explained that in certain states, insurance must be kept on the car until the plates are surrendered. The policyholder wanted to backdate the cancellation of the coverage to avoid penalties, but the representative explained that this would result in fines from the DMV and may result in license suspension. The policyholder insisted on removing coverage from the date he surrendered the plates but demanded a refund for July. The representative explained that they cannot refund July as they provided coverage for that month, but the policyholder insisted that he should not have to pay since he did not have the car. The representative explained the state law and policy terms but the policyholder demanded a goodwill credit and spoke to a supervisor who told him the same thing as the representative. The policyholder gave a bad survey because the call center prioritized state law over good customer service.~~Working for an insurance company, the author's job involves determining the number of claims made and what deductible applies. Sometimes customers will try to commit insurance fraud by filing several accidents as one claim. The author speaks to a customer who claimed damage to his parked car while out of state when someone hit his parked car. The customer also claimed rear damage, which the author explains is from a second incident, meaning there are two separate accidents, and therefore two $1,000 deductibles. The customer refuses to pay two $1,000 deductibles and asks how the author knows it wasn't just one accident.~~The claims rep for an insurance company deals with frequent fraudulent claims, but one stood out. After an insured backed into a parked vehicle, he denied causing damage and provided a witness to corroborate his story. However, the witness turned out to be the insured's mother, whose car he was driving during the incident. The insurance company paid out for the damages caused, but the insured's policy was cancelled, and he and his mother are under investigation for running a scam through their auto repair business.~~An insurance company has temporarily stopped covering customers using their vehicles for ride-sharing services, like Uber or Lyft, due to a cost assessment. A customer called to extend their policy, only to be informed that he would need to provide a document from Uber stating he would no longer be using his car for ride-sharing, because the policy being renewed specifically excluded this. The customer was dissatisfied with this news, shouting and cursing at the service representative. Ultimately, the service rep suggested the customer look for another company because his coverage would end soon.~~An insurance customer service representative recounts an encounter with a difficult client who threatened to contact a lawyer over a policy clause that couldn't be changed. The representative, who has years of experience, was unfazed by the threat and advised the client to do as he deemed fit. The client disconnected the call, sparing both parties from further unpleasantness. The representative emphasizes that front line employees do not care about idle threats made in the heat of the moment.~~A woman called an insurance company on her boyfriend's behalf to ask about the minimum payment needed to reactivate his policy. The customer service representative informed her that they could take a payment of $100 to reactivate the policy with a lapse in coverage or review other options if she could speak with the named insured, John. After speaking with John, the representative informed him that he needed to pay $250 to get caught up for the months of July through September since no payments had been received since June. John refused to consent to a required verbal disclosure and could not reactivate the policy. He berated the representative and disconnected the call.~~The author works in a call center handling glass claims for insured individuals, which includes processing claims for broken glass in vehicles. They explain that most claims are straightforward, but sometimes people are unreasonable. The author then describes a call they received from someone on a road trip whose brand new car had been hit by debris from an 18-wheeler, damaging the windshield and driver rear door glass. However, due to a shortage of windshield inventory, the glass needed to be back-ordered. The author offered help by arranging for a clear plastic windshield until a new one could be shipped, which the owner was grateful for, although their husband continued to be upset.~~A customer called for a quote to change his vehicle but started complaining about how long it took the previous day to get a quote that wasn't even possible since he didn't have enough information about the vehicle. The employee recognised his voice from yesterday and suggested that it should only take between 5 to 10 minutes as long as the customer has all the required information. The customer didn't have his policy number or vehicle registration and could not provide it after five minutes of looking; instead, he decided to call back later. The employee found it humorous when customers complained about wait times but failed to have the necessary information on hand.~~An insurance call center worker shares a story of a customer who canceled their policy due to a premium increase and claimed to have gotten a new policy with another company. The worker cancels the policy and the customer later calls back saying they didn't get another policy and had been in an accident, wanting the original policy reactivated to cover the loss. The worker declines, hoping that the customer wasn't at fault or has enough money to cover the loss.~~A woman called her insurance company about not being able to claim for a burglary at her house because her insurance still covered her previous address. At first, the company was worried that someone had made a mistake, but they found out that the woman had moved five years prior and never informed the company.

The woman cancelled her policy after being upset that she hadn't been insured correctly for five years. The insurance company did not cover the burglary.~~An employee at a health insurance company shared an interesting experience of a caller falsely claiming a denial of their dental claim.

The customer wanted to contact the other driver's insurance company but did not want to file a claim under their own policy.

After a fifteen-minute conversation, the customer finally understood and ended the call. The representative was relieved and took a smoke break.~~A woman called an insurance company to complain about her bill, which had increased by $15,000 every six months, after it was discovered that she had lied about her daughter's driving record being clean. The woman cancelled her policy immediately, but had to pay over $5,000 to make up for the underpayment of her first two months of insurance. She refused to pay, arguing that she had been quoted a lower rate, and fraud was being committed. However, the agent informed the woman that all calls were recorded and that the woman had engaged in material misrepresentation at the inception of her policy. The woman hung up but paid the amount owed about a month later.~~An insurance worker had a difficult phone call with an 80-year-old male customer who had a female-sounding voice. The man was questioning a bill he received and became increasingly irate when the insurance worker tried to explain how she could help him resolve the issue. The man became increasingly angry, couldn't be placated and questioned the worker repeatedly for 30 minutes. She tried to explain the information on his ID card, but in the end, he hung up, calling her ""worthless.""~~An angry customer called an insurance company about their home policy that is still active despite attempts to cancel since June. The customer claimed to have sent multiple documents proving the sale of the house, but the notes and email system show no record of this.

Despite being asked to send the document, the customer refused and demanded a supervisor. The escalation representative remained patient, but the customer continued to argue and did not want a solution.~~The author works in car insurance claims and received a call from a man wanting to file a claim for damage to a previously replaced car part.

Later, the author discovered the complaint was unrelated and no further action was taken by the customer.~~The writer shares their frustration at being yelled at by customers who want their deductible changed. They explain that insurance policies allow customers to choose their deductible, which affects their monthly premium. The writer's job is to help people file claims, not change their policy.

The writer reminds customers that they are not responsible for policy coverage choices.~~A man who claims to drive for Uber demands that his insurance provider sends him updated documents. When it is established that he uses his car for ride-sharing and therefore requires higher liability limits, the man initially agrees to increase his coverage but changes his story upon receiving the associated increased monthly rate.

The author enjoyed this job.~~A debt collector offered a program with six months at zero interest to a woman who was just a few days late making her payment for the first time ever.

The employee confirmed the customer's address and ensured their statements were not being suppressed, but there was nothing wrong, so the issue may have been with the post office. The customer requested another statement be sent and said they would pay when they received it. The employee was surprised at the customer's lack of understanding regarding payment requirements and the use of computers.","Lady is horrified when she gets an immediate response to a text!~~800 calls in 5 hours~~""I don't have to pay the interest and you can't make me!""

At this job, there are three questions on the survey that correlate to three stats: likely to shop again, customer effort, and associate satisfaction. Anything less than the top answer on a question is essentially a zero. Surveys are a numbers game, the more you get, the more things even out. But the CSR keeps getting pulled from chat to SMS, which stunts the amount of surveys that get counted into their stats and keeps them stuck at a 99.43% LTS score or even driving it further down.

The customer becomes aggressive and curses before hanging up.~~Airline workers are trained to understand geography and time zones. Jet lag occurs when passengers travel from east to west and arrive at their destination before the expected time.

Once the supervisor got on the line and asked for her booking details, they discovered that the woman's flight was actually scheduled for the next day.~~A frustrated customer complains about a 20-minute wait to speak with a representative, but can't provide her account information. The representative tries to assist her, but the customer doesn't know where she's traveling from or to, can’t confirm if she was charged, and can't check her email.

The airline's employee explained that the refund process could take up to 8 weeks due to the high volume of refund requests from Covid-19, but the client expresses frustration and demands for a supervisor to expedite the process.

Midway, the man asked to hold for a couple of minutes and placed the phone somewhere, causing the worker to hear breathing noises.

They concluded the man preferred the free airline hotline to an erotic line.~~A customer complains to a customer service representative that their internet service is not working, but the representative discovers that the activation date is not until the following week.

The representative tells the customer a story about a friend whose luggage was misplaced on a flight. The customer accuses the representative of lying, and the call ends.~~Passengers often claim their reservations didn't go through on the website to get a discount on their flight fare.

Despite several years passing since the incident, the original writer never discovered whether or not the caller ever resumed flying.~~A woman purchased 60 thousand miles for $2,000 and tried to use them for a trip that only required 30 thousand miles. The airline representative had to explain that purchasing miles is meant to accumulate miles towards a free ticket or to use them to subsidize expensive tickets, not the inverse.

Consequently, she told the airline representative that she would never fly with the 'piece of shit company' again.~~""Reprotecting"" is a term used in the airline industry when a flight is delayed or cancelled and another airline is contacted to provide flights to the same destination.

The man demanded compensation for his trouble and humiliation, but the author refused, causing the man to threaten to sue everyone involved. Despite warnings, the man continued to yell and was eventually disconnected.~~Customers often call asking if they have a flight or if someone else does, usually to fish for confidential information, and this is frustrating for the person answering the call. But one customer who called insisting that he had a flight for the day was humoured until it was discovered that the booking was for the day before and he had been a no-show. Instead of informing the customer of this, the agent falsely claimed that there were no active bookings under his name and no-goed his ticket, causing him to receive no refund for the expensive ticket.~~Working for an IT support service for airlines, they receive calls from workers reporting issues with their workstations.

They have to call airlines to verify cancellations and what documentation is required for refunds.

As a result, customers were sold tickets for non-existent flights, and many were left disappointed at the last minute due to the lack of space on alternate carriers.

Me stays on the line, guiding the customer until the engineer arrives. The text highlights the importance of customers reporting potential gas leaks and following safety procedures.~~Emergency calls for outages are common at the power company call center, with only half of these calls actually being outages.

One customer demanded to speak to a cell phone company's CEO and worked her way up to the operations manager of the entire site. However, he refused to connect her to his own supervisor, as it was not required and there was nobody in customer service above him.
