0.0,"Where I work, we're supposed to somewhat lay down with the insincere ""I'm sorry to hear that, how can I help?"" And only if the customer continues, we warn them before eventually hang up.

That said, we also had meetings about lost work and some POS screaming is very likely going to get a click from me. If no account populated during that call, there is less hesitation.~~I heard a customer saying that his girl needs to be beaten for not working or not cleaning the house or making dinner. I got my boss attention and I put everything I heard in close notes. And I mentioned that everything he said was on a recorded line. After I assisted him the said bye and I hung up. I was very livid.~~Jay-Z wanted a free iPhone 5 when it came out. His PA called in and really tried her best to get through the system, and reach someone high enough to get him a free iPhone. As I heard, he does this for many products, but usually gets nothing, since he is notorious cheapskate.~~We've all had this guy. In this this guy's case I would've said, ""/you want my supervisor, I'll be happy to get HER for you, however company policy states that before an escalation to a supervisor an occur I must have a verified account. For that I'll need your account number please."" 

I know this may not be word-for-word, but I spent 15yrs in call centers and ""please"" will prevent this type of call 83% of the time.~~As a female who deals with clients 95% over email, I recently changed my signature to the male nickname of my given name (think Alex for Alexandria.) 

In the month since I changed, the increased amount of respect has been mind boggling. No more 5 emails back and forth questioning my decisions. No more cc'ing in my male boss when they don't like my answer. It's been glorious.

Also congrats on your ""new"" addition and the ability to spend that time bonding with your family.~~I called an airlines once when there was a lot of bad weather so they were rescheduling flights. I got this poor woman who was clearly exhausted based on her tone. Instead of calling her bitter (WTF??), I acknowledged that she was probably feeling overwhelmed and let her know how much I appreciate her helping me. By the end of the call, she sounded much more chipper.~~We get these calls a lot in particular because our name is similar enough to another retailer that people often get us confused. One example was a woman who was absolutely screaming at me because her lamp was defective and I was insisting that we do not now, nor have we ever sold lamps. 

It took quite some convincing that we are not who she is looking for but when she finally got there she was extremely apologetic.~~Oh no! I worked in a collections department and we were told that even on mute we were recorded (we weren't, but they told us that) so we got into a habit of unplugging our headset to curse or yell at particularly difficult people, then we'd plug back in and say, ""I'm so sorry, the line broke up, would you mind repeating that last bit?"" Sometimes, you just have to let it out.~~I cracked like that once during an escalation i was taking. The caller didn't apologize but then added my unprofessionalism to the list of reasons me and the company I work for suck. I stuck my tail in my legs and continued the call and never heard of it again. If people where just nice to each other so much more would get accomplished.~~I overheard someone on the floor get a call like this, and I've had at least two calls I've had to escalate to get police to do a wellness check (callers mentioned suicide/self-harm, so we send the police to the address on file) it's really rough. you did a good job. i hope she's okay. :)~~When I worked customer service at Cabelas on of the most potent weapons was silence. Give them facts, tell them their options, then be quiet. Let them decide. Do not offer excuses, do not apologize. Policy is what it is. I am not sorry for doing my job. If they are nice we will see what I can do. If they moan and bitch it is straight policy. They are waiting for you to bend to what they want you to do not wanting you to follow what you are supposed to do.~~I get that occasionally too.

Lately I just say ""beep boop hold please"" and then place them on hold for like five seconds.

I pick the line back up and resume like nothing happened. Co-workers find it hilarious, including my boss.

Haven't had a customer say anything about it yet. Not sure what they're thinking.

I do live chat for our website too. People ask if we're real and our response is typically ""unfortunately the humans are still in control."" Most people are amused and continue. Some get incredibly confused. At least on live chat it's a legit question though.~~\&gt;  I let my supervisor know what happened and she said I should have *maybe* tried to de-escalate a little bit more 

Lol, what?  I'd be responding to your supervisor; 'Just so that we're clear for my HR complaint, your advice is that customer service representatives should accept abuse on the phone and try to de-escalate said abuse?'

The second somebody swears or insults me over the phone, I inform them that 'I'm terminating the call as a result of your conduct.  When you're ready to have a grown up conversation, please call back at your convenience', then hang up.  ~~I work for a utility company. People will often threaten company employees. A lot of times its clearly not anything, but when you say you want to kill the CEO and youre on a recorded line, we have to report it. 

Most of the time Im somewhat happy about it, because it means I will have a ten-minute break from taking calls while I fill out the security incident report. Had to issue one for a 90-year-old man who said he was going to smash our equipment with a hammer. Never a dull moment.~~We had the secret service call in so we could service a former presidents home! They had to do background checks on everyone that came out to the home and we totally thought it was a joke at first. They dont fuck around though!! It was really cool
Edit- this was also only like 5 months ago so super fresh on my mind~~Oh man, thats awful! Im glad you hung up on that nasty bigot.

Ive actually been on the customer end of this interaction (only in thinking I was on hold but in reality was muted). But instead of a terrible racial slur, I was caught doing the god awful baby voice to my cat. Something along the lines of come here you lil fluff butt! you want pets? ooooh yess you luhhhhh da pets! thats a good girl!! youre MY good girl! 

To my absolute horror, the person looking into my account info came back on the line cracking up, and needless to say I was mortified LOL. Thankfully, it ended up with us both chatting about how we love animals but I definitely learned my lesson to pay attention to what I say when Im not sure if the other person can hear me!~~We get these on a daily basis in my call center. Men faking their wive's voice. Women faking their husband's voice. Parents faking their child's voice.  


The problem is, if they can verify the information, there's not much we can do. If we try to call them out, there's always the off chance that we actually ARE talking to the wife and can end up insulting someone. It's really frustrating.~~Those ppl.  I will say they did teach me something though.  When I get someone who asks for me because they don't want to speak to an off shore rep because they ""want someone who speaks English "", I will take a page from Ken's book and elevate my vocabulary like crazy.  You wanted English smart ass, I'll give you English.~~I hate people like this.  I place them on ""time out"" holds because I'm not paid enough to deal with this crap.  Since it's not a critical quality error but just ""customer experience "" or whatever I'll just tell them ""hold one moment"" and hit the button.  They can damn well wait.  I refuse to give them a say in the matter.  I'm aggressive with my transfers too.  ""Let me get you connected to x one moment"" and click hard and fast.  I will not beg for permission to do what I need to do.  They put it on qualities.  I nod and keep doing it.  Meh.  (I'm a bad person.  Don't be like me. Lol)

Sounds like your free now.  Hope it gets better!~~My old company told us that if people were shouting or swearing at us, we should think about what we might have done to make them do that, and apologise. Fuck. That. One warning - then gone. I loved it when people swore because I knew Id be hanging up. I cant help you while you swear at me. If you do it again, I will hang up - they almost always called me a fucking bitch at that point, so *click*.~~I used to work for a health insurance company and I used to have long involved emails conversations with one man for about 2 years. None of the other managers liked this guy because he was a bit of a grumpy old complainy pants customer so that's how he'd ended up being handballed to me.


I was in line for a promotion to team leader at the time and he had noticed the ""acting"" part of my title and congratulated me on it. Wanting to know when I got it so we could go to lunch to celebrate 

The day after I got the role I went to email him to tell him the news, only to find he'd passed away the week before.

Not gonna lie, I cried for Mr Morris and 6 years later I still miss talking to that cranky old bugger~~I've been there.

I was helping two ladies with something for their phone and right before I had to transfer them I heard them say ""he sounds like a robot""

I wish I responded with ""no this job is just so crushing having to help people like you"" and hung up.

But yeah I feel your pain. Try to do anything to get out~~I'd just like to take a moment to appreciate this woman.  She's fighting with some dude about what is probably a pretty stressful situation, but she didn't take it out on you.  Instead, made sure YOU had a pleasant conversation with her.  More people need to be like this woman.~~Yup; had this exact situation on a call about half an hour ago. I got asked my name (which you know, is to intimidate me into giving her what she wants) and 'threatened' with her taking her not actually business elsewhere. I offered her the number of the other company she wanted to call cos it was on our database lol~~I hate, hate, HAAAAAAATE when people ""hello"" me.  Every 2 seconds of silence doesn't need to be filled with you hello-ing me! I get it from everyone and it makes me nuts.  Sometimes I'm waiting for some POS system to load, or I just need to think, or like you said process the steam roll they just laid over me.  So infuriating~~","The commenter shares a story about a customer who wanted a free iPhone 5 when it came out, but the company's policy states that before an escalation to a supervisor, the customer must have a verified account. The commenter suggests that the customer's behavior was unacceptable and that the company should have"
0.0,"Not sure why I was reminded of this, but my grandmother told me a story about her switchboard operator days. Some perv kept calling in and as soon as the operator would answer hed say, Ive got a 6 inch willy. (Hey, it was the fifties.) As soon as he got hung up on, hed call back. The operators would shout out to each other whenever they got his call, I got him! Yep, got em! Finally, he landed with my grandmother. He whispered into the phone, Ive got a six inch willy! She replied, Oh you poor dear, what happened? Never heard from him again.~~We used to get customers like that all the time. I would send them a receipt showing the time and date the refund was processed and send them on their way. Usually people refused to believe that banks actually take time to move money around and it doesn't just magically appear in their accounts.~~Certain systems even whilst on hold the customer is still being recorded.

 I used to do phone audits on call centre staff and had to listen through the person being on hold, so as not to miss any call, you would hear the hold music with the customer over the top of it.~~I had an encounter earlier this evening. I was done with people's bullshit so I put myself on training mode so I could document all the bullshit and be petty while I write every little snarky thing down, a trick I pulled off of a tech's ticket that was 100% snark:

""Tech said he did not need a ticket number because he was driving. Tech was informed he needed a ticket. Tech insisted that no other company had a ticket system and to just talk to a tech. Asked tech if he wanted to talk to a tech and if so, will call back a t a later date? Tech suddenly had ticket number""

Fuck dude, what are you expecting? I'm just so TIRED of people's shit so hopefully the feigning innocence of ""So you want to call back when you're not busy?!"" line usually gets them to snap to it. Pricks.~~Another problem with the mute button that so many people don't think of is that the customers on the line with the rep next to you may be hearing you curse out your customer. I've only had it once where a customer asked for a sup because the girl next to me was loud with her cursing, but it does happen. And yes, she ended up fired over it.~~I work in emergency roadside assistance. I drop my customer service voice often. If someone's in an emergency: they need a real person. Not the roadside barbie. If someone is rude, or unwilling to listen, or questioning my ability to help them : I drop my tone and my voice and I get more respected for it. Being sugary sweet isn't always the most needed thing in customer service.~~The worst, make my heart drop into my stomach call, was from a man who's claims were being denied. He told me before he disconnected that he was the ceo and wasn't happy. People claim this a lot honestly. I took the time to google his name and he had his own Wikipedia page! He had not lied and worked for a very large well known pharmaceutical company..


I immediately called my supervisor at home and the issue was sent to an agent who works with the company directly. We call theses members VIP because they can influence their company to take their insurance business elsewhere. ~~&gt;I just don't think I'm built for call centers, I'm not sure how much longer I can go without snapping and really hurting someone's feelings/losing my job.

You need to hang your soul at the door and pick it up on the way out.  Let them rant and rave in one ear and out the other.  Just listen for the real problem and address that when they run out of energy.~~Yeah, the suspense of a third unknowing party listening is is what those people need. Its sick and disrespectful to you as a phone operator. Yuck. I am in a profession where my employees get those kind of phonecalls to. They are certainly allowed to disconnect as soon as they know where that call will be leading to.~~Thankfully in my job we have no AHT target, so if we get a rambly caller we just roll with it. I don't work in an emergency breakdown call centre so it's a bit more easygoing.

Sometimes people call up just to have a chat. Lockdown has resulted in some lonely people, especially from the elderly crowd. I genuinely feel for them, so if I get a caller like that I'll roll with it and be their companion for a little while. Eventually though I'll have to use the ""we have other customers waiting"" line (even if we don't) so that they'll let me go.~~Sounds a lot like [this post](

&amp;#x200B;

Is this something that actually happens often at call centers? admittedly I don't nor have I ever worked at one (Applied at Horizon Wireless once), I just follow the sub for the fun stories.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Holy hell, I didn't realize I was kicking a hornet's nest! These are all crazy stories! Could almost make a separate post on these alone! Thank you all for sharing!~~Totally agree these past almost two years have been a challenge to all of us that work in some sort of customer support, whether in person, over the phone, or via chat. The entitlement had only gotten worse and I dont see it being dialed back one bit. 

Honestly youre my hero for dropping the voice.~~Thats awesome! Ive actually had to put call center employees on hold when Ive called from work. It never fails, I get hours without a member (work in a gym) needing anything and as soon as I get to an employee someone walks up needing to talk to me about something.~~I envy you for being so professional during it! I recently had a guy do the exact same thing, and I was shaking all over because I absolutely cannot deal with angry people. Paradoxically, I also started giggling at times, because he kept calling me names, and I full on laughed when he screamed ""you dopey fucking bitch"" at me, lmao.~~I get so many NFL players it's not funny. I know someone on my team got DJ Khalid once. Someone else got Carly Rae Jepsen (twice) and one of the Trump ladies. I've personally handled Cuba Gooding Jr's account and I think the estate of Marvin Gaye. Of course, I never know people are famous until after they call. Credit card fraud happens to just about about anyone.~~With those customers, I don't say a single word. I let them rant and jot down some notes. Usually once they have cycled thru their story about the 4th time, they realize I've been completely silent... then go ""hello?"" And then I finally reply with ""I'm here, I've just been listening..."" sometimes that calms them enough to stfu but every once in a while it riles them up again where they feel the need to repeat themselves. Then we repeat the silence. Sometimes you gotta throw in the obligatory ""I totally hear you...""  or ""that's understandable"". It's amazing the human condition makes people crave those words.~~Had one like this. 

""I see you're calling about [x], how can I help?""

""Well, we're just getting it set up. ""

""Oh ok, awesome. Is something not working right?""

""No, no. Its all fine. Should I wait until there's a problem to call?""

""Oh, um. I mean if you have any questions I can answer them?""

""No, no.  It's OK for now. Well call back if something happens.""

Ok? Nice talking to you!~~I had a woman call in once and was like ""So we've just set up our tv onto the wall, and our 3 year old son threw a ball and it hit and smashed the TV, what can we do?"" I just laughed and said, well there's nothing we'll be able to do if your son has smashed your TV...~~I spoke with Booker T and his wife once. Funny thing is, I had NO idea who they were. Another agent had them signed up for so many products they didnt need, and they wanted help understanding exactly what they had. Once they realized I didn't know who they were, they were so relieved. He said at one point, he was glad I didn't know who he was, because I was able to treat him like a regular person. Apparently people get so starstruck, they try to scam them/upsell them. ~~I'm 99.9% sure she wanted you to panic and just do what she asked, and was unwilling to believe she had called the wrong department... I frequently get a much less extreme version where someone bought a tablet or something 8 months ago and now decided they don't want it anymore with 16 months left on the contract. They always say ""the rep at the store FORCED me to buy it!"" To which I always reply ""they physically prevented you from leaving the store until you agreed to buy it??? Have you contacted the police yet?""~~I politely called people out. ""It's okay to be frustrated, but please don't make this personal. I want to help you the best I can."" First they blow up because none of us are very good at being called out on our bad behavior, but after the initial shock they *usually* chill out a bit. Some of them even apologize. I train now and I tell all of my agents that we absolutely do not get paid to take personal abuse. We may not be able to hang up unless it's extreme, but no amount of money is enough to be dehumanized. 

I also tell them not to accept personal responsibility for things they didn't do. It is your job to own the resolution to the problem, but it's not your personal fault that some meth head delivered their order incorrectly.~~OP, don't listen to these people. The customer was merely projecting. You gave them a calm, blank canvas and they decided that since they're miserable in their lives, you must be as well.

These people telling you that it's your responsibility to make up for your customer's lack of emotional intelligence are completely off the mark.~~When I worked for a Canadian telecom (they were very proud that all of their agents were in Canada), the policy was to state the city you were in, but most agents were based out of call centres in Ontario or the Maritimes.

I would tell people my province if they asked. I was in a completely remote call centre (it was literally the WFH call centre) so I was not about to tell them the city I was in, and definitely not after I moved to a small town.~~You are one lucky phone monkey.

My company, a customer has to be so abusive that the Floor Sup takes it to a Team Sup, who take is to a Mangler, who takes it to a mis-Director, who goes to the VP and maybe we will get to cold transfer them to a voice mail... if the front line phone monkey remembers to check the notes on the account.

And yes, ""Phone Monkey"" is a term of endearment.~~",The commenter shared a story about their grandmother's switchboard operator days where a customer kept calling in and the operator would respond with a six-inch willy. The commenter used to do phone audits on call center staff and had to listen through the person being on hold to avoid missing any calls.
0.0,"""Oh, mensa. Isn't that the private organization that will allow anybody in, after their check clears?""

But on a somewhat related note. I once took a call from some guy that wasn't rude or down talking. Actually a super nice guy and I really enjoyed speaking with him.  But he kept talking about how he discovered something that's gonna turn computing on its head. He was like ""I'll sort of break it down like I'm teaching one of my classes"".

I didn't care. Average handle time be damned.  It was super fucking interesting, what he was talking about.

Turned out to be Marko Rodin~~There are some crazies out there.  When I was working the phones for a bank with a stagecoach logo, some of my more noteworthy ones:

-Man who needed an emergency loan because the Yakuza was after him

-Man who said we completely vacated the state of Idaho, despite the fact we had a phone center and several branches there, including one less than a mile from his address

-Man who would hang up immediately on male agents, but would ask detailed questions to female agents about their feet and be generally creepy

Edit: trying to fix formatting, on mobile~~The real stupidity here is in thinking that he's gonna get someone to help him by being an asshole.  I'll go above and beyond to help most people, but once they cross the line I'm only gonna do the bare minimum and just try to get them off the phone.~~Good lord, what a moron. 

I once had someone call (in the late afternoon which is when we are slammed- I work with doctors offices and MDs themselves, mostly) who called himself an MD and ask us for our phone number. 

The number he dialed to get to us. 

He waited on hold for almost 40 minutes for that.~~""Are you a machine?"" ""Not last I checked, sir."" \*fairly normal call* ""Do you have any questions?"" ""Yes, will I ever speak with a live person again?"" ""I apologize, sir, I don't know anything about your personal life.""

And then he laughed, thankfully. Ah, the days before every call was recorded.~~Once made an outbound call to check on some activity on a client's credit card, just needed the owner to confirm it was them and not some hacker in russia. The husband of the cardholder answered and pretended to have a coughing fit whenever i tried to talk. Suspended card. Notes stated exactly why. Im sure the client had some things to say to her husband later...~~My last day at the call center (I had put in my 2 weeks but 3 days into my notice I was just nonstop getting shit on by customers and couldnt take it) I just gave everyone what they wanted  $10 credit because you couldnt work your remote and there was nothing actually wrong? Fuck it. You want a tech because you unplugged your cable box and now you cant get it back on? Sure hows tomorrow? Literally rolled trucks all day and then the next morning dropped all my shit at the front desk and left~~This is a big reason why every call center I worked at told us to never give our locations.

I would always say Texas.

Open carry is a thing there.

The few times that did nothing, I try to ignore it or find a way to get them to talk about guns - ranges, favorite types etc. And lean in gently with a "" I really LOVE the FN SCAR H. So little recoil, 250 rounds a minute. Great range. You know, it's a really great military rifle..."" 


Whether or not it's correct information, the topic changes swiftly and call goes smoothly.

You doin ok OP?~~I feel the cringe!  Lol i know the feeling where the call starts off awkward, and is doomed from there.

Sometimes my lips dont work, and sometimes there is a slight delay on our phone system.  This turns into ""Great! Is there anything I can help buh buh find... err check on for you?""- followed by a physical palm on face.

This is usually the end of the awkward calls with delay that have 2 or 3 ""sorry-- you go ahead"", followed by both parties talking at the same time again.

Sometimes you gotta embrace the cringe and laugh it off.

Thanks for the story; I felt like I was there, haha!~~Im very proud of you too. Its hard to take someones hatred and show them how theyre behaving, and he definitely felt ashamed at taking his frustration out on the wrong person. 

Keep at it; the VA is a really rough one to work. So many of them got jilted in the most painful way. Best wishes.~~That's so awful. When I worked in a call center I would deal with this type if situation by staying completely silent as they ranted and raved, so that they'd have to ask if I was still there once they stopped. I'd say calmly and cheerfully, 'I was just letting you finish.' - I tried to imagine I was dealing with a tantrum-ing toddler. It usually made them feel really foolish that I wasn't reacting at all to their hysterics. Repeat until they're able to speak to you like a grown up. 

Anyway I hope the employee is feeling better!~~I had a borrower that pull that shit with me. I asked them for one moment while I finish a note on prior call, who hung up on me. I cause they thought I put them on hold. Really I just muted them and they called me a bitch that wasnt ready and they where on hold for hours. I told them Im still here can I get your loan number? Shocked silence then they hung up.~~I do cell tech support and have to use analogies all the time. We're a cell provider and have to refer to the manufacturer for software issues. I have to use the ""If you have an issue with the way your car runs, do you go to the gas station for it, or a mechanic?"" analogy at least a couple times per week.~~I had this once, i provided all possible solutions and they screamed ""I WILL JUST LEAVE SINCE YOU DONT WANT TO HELP ME!!""

After 20 minutes of trying to help this idiot i finally said. "" I never said i wont help you, i have provided you all possible solutions that i could provide, would you like to go foreward with one of these or would you like me to get a supervisor?""

silence, then ""okay we can do that.."" 

Quiet and polite the rest of the call. Sometimes you just gotta tell them whats what.~~To be fair, I've worked in some really loud call centers with some really bad headsets. Some days the caller and I could barely hear each other over the din. 

My current company invested in really good headsets, a white noise machine (don't even notice it, but it works), a better soundproofing in general. Now there's just a general buzz of work in the air and no one has to shout to be heard.~~I was walking my dogs with my wife and there were a 1/2 dozen kids climbing onto a roof from a garbage can. Wondering WTF they were doing we strolled down that street. There in the backyard is a trampoline and theyre jumping off the roof onto it. We stop to watch and they all freeze and look guilty. Probably thought we were gonna get mad or something. 

Im just waiting for you to jump!

So he did, we all laughed and had a good time.

It sounds like your job is talking to all those NextDoor busy bodies. Im sorry you have to live that hell.~~When I worked for the cable company we had to apologize for any and every complaint, even if it was unrelated to the call. If the customer said ""Ow, I stubbed my toe"" we'd get marked down if we didn't response ""I'm sorry you stubbed your toe."" The only exception was after the customer said ""stop saying you're sorry"" or something similar. Then you'd get marked down if you slipped and apologized.~~I also suffer from Resting Bitch Voice. Had a lady I was training once tell our manager I was mean, he looked at her and said ""I was sitting next to you the whole time, that's just how she talks""  
I'm tired and old and don't have it in me to have a customer friendly voice all day, I know my job that's what they pay me to do.~~Oh Lord I hate it when our system is down, or updating, or undergoing maintenance. ""Well can't you just..."" is the go to response. As if there is some secret part of the system just for them kept separate from the rest that we keep up Just in case they call.~~I've had similar experiences from time to time, running a convenience store, and also times where I was threatened with legal action, in which case I literally begged the customer to either sue me, and/or report me to the lotto commission/liquor authority/health department, etc.

Never once has anyone complained to the authorities or come back to have a second inning after I tell them off.

Your story illustrates what I have also found: a twat is a twat; they know they're being twats; they likewise know when they've gone too far in the twat department.~~It is a glorious thing isn't it?  I absolutely adore that our company lets us hang up on verbally abusive people, doesn't even have to be things like asshole or bitch, if you call someone a dickhead or a retard or say they only got the job through blow jobs we can hang up on you.  We can choose to give a warning first ""I'm going to ask you to moderate your language or I am going to hang up"" then hang up if they do it again, but that warning almost always results in ""I""d like to see you try bitch"".  Which.. really? What kind of come back is that over the phone?  How hard do you think it is to disconnect a call?

A nice bonus though is when they call back to complain about ""that bitch who hung up on me. I want her fired.""  ""That was me ma'am. Good day."" &lt;click&gt;~~Not a celebrity exactly, but when I did tech support for a large (now non-existent) internet provider, one of the tech guys from the jimmy kimmel show called in because his internet wasnt working. I was able to get it fixed easily and he offered me free tickets to a taping of the show. ~~I admire the urge to explain but you might've outed yourself unnecessarily. Theres a chance she wouldnt have complained and theres a chance that that call would have fallen through the cracks of the calls your company listens too.

Source: I also work for a call centre and have had similar moments and somehow still have a job.~~Well, our ITSM (IT Service Manager) once called our line when I started working there and he was acting like he owns me. But with my experience with people in person I was calm. Then he said he's gonna fire me because I'm unprofessional as hell. Well, it was opposite. He was replaced 4 days after this call and put 4 positions below his previous position. Which is Business Developer. Lol.~~",The commenter had a bad experience with a customer who kept talking about how he discovered something that was going to turn computing on its head. The commenter didn't care about the average handle time and didn't want to deal with the customer's behavior. They also had a bad experience with
0.0,"Oh thats awful. Im assuming there were rules about giving out your personal phone number or something similar? (It might also be just not thinking of it when you had the chance.) At least, this is what I would have wanted to do. 

My intent wasnt to make you feel guilty. Just that I have empathy for you both, and its like I want to give the guy my phone number too. Loneliness is such a powerful and depressing emotion. One that is so easily remedied in the scheme of things, but can happen to fall to the wayside due to our own lives. Im gonna hope that he met people where he went, and just didnt need to call anymore.~~The screaming kids in the background has to be the worst hands down.

Driving customers has to be my favourite as when you ask for details (mainly for security or to help with their query) they always respond with I cant do that as Im driving at the moment! Well, maybe dont call while youre driving then??~~The other day I had a call like this.

Some lady called wanting to do a month long holiday around many parts of spain, i explained the process and booked a room for her (I work reservations) but then she said she wanted to do it herself and she booked a lotta rooms online with me on the phone explaining everything and helping her when she needed it.

We joked, talked a little bit and after a day with many rude costumers and entitled assholes that hour long call made me feel useful again.~~Your colleagues are in on the act,  
Put me through to your colleagues!

I'm still in disbelief at the sheer amount of people who'll call you a liar,  
As soon as a manager (or your colleague pretending to be a manager),  
Suddenly it becomes true or they finally accept it...~~This happens a lot, and not just to old people. Good for your company for fixing it! I once had to replace a debit card because no one would admit responsibility for a repeating charge and take it off. I had to change the card number so it would stop going through.~~My favorite is when you tell them no, and their response is to act like you're just not understanding them.

""I think we are having a miscommunication. I'm asking for x.""

""I understand, but we can't do that. I've offered y and z, but we cannot do x.""

""No, you're not understanding what I'm asking.""

It's infuriating. Just because you don't like my answer doesn't mean I didn't understand what you want or that I'm stupid.~~Call Center job interview, a (very) short play...  
Manager:  ""So, you have any self respect?""  
Interviewee:  ""Why, Yes Sir, I do!""  
Manager:  ""Yea, that's a deal breaker for us.  We get a few folks who lie about that on occasion, they don't last long.  We're looking for a more numb, apathetic, not quite ready to blow their brains out vibe"".~~These types of people do my head in, especially the ones that call &amp; say ""I'm calling about X"" then just go silent, like ok what about X is it that you need help with? Am I meant to be reading your mind right now or were you expecting a pre-recorded message of FAQs?~~Good for you. 

Years ago, I managed a call center for software support. Part of the training included this sentence: ""The words you are using (or volume of your voice) are interfering with my ability to focus on your problem."" 

If that didn't work, the next line was, ""I can see that you are upset. Please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx when you are calm enough to communicate clearly."" (Employees were allowed to politely hang up on abusive callers.) 

Having a go-to response helps in the heat of the moment. Always be professional and polite, but enforce your boundaries.~~And this is the reason why I am calm and courteous to anyone working on a help line.

A) It's way more likely they will be inclined to help me

B) I was on the other end of those calls for 5 years, and know what a difference it makes. ~~I used to work at an answering service, and we had a client who provides town cars/SUV/limos for people flying in or just getting from point A to B. Ive spoken to Alex Gaskarth from the band All Time Low, a couple different Baltimore Ravens players, and NHL player Chris Brown (at the time he was playing for the Phoenix Coyotes). But my all time favorite was Mallory Lewis. Her mom Shari was the original puppeteer of Lamb Chop, and Mallory took over after her mom passed away. Lamb Chop was my favorite show as a kid, and I was so excited to be talking to Mallory. She was super nice and didnt mind talking to me for a few extra minutes. ~~Dude. Unless you flat out cuss at a customer you may get a warning. Maybe something documented in your personnel file. 

Most supervisors and leaders know youre a person too and will let a small amount of snark go. Especially if the customer was asking for it. At least at my call center job. Ive been pulled for the come to jesus, you cant talk to customers that way meeting at least 6 times since I started my job. Just with different supervisors. I have like zero filter, but somehow, I still work there after 14 years.~~This one actually hurt to read because of the excruciatingly accurate details.  The only thing I would add was the late Sunday afternoon dread feeling that I would get thinking about going through another week of misery.

I did it for 7 years and finally had to leave for my own health and sanity.    The one thing I tell people all the time about my job (a phone/cable company mostly billing with some sales) was that I lost all of my compassion. I have heard every possible story why people dont pay bills, death in family, lost job, illness, natural disaster, personal tragedy, roommate situation, etc.. I just became desensitized because either they were lying or there was nothing I could do about it. 

Its been 6 years since I left and I sleep much better at night~~I swear I've worked on campaigns where the customer would start off the conversation (when they finally got through to me) by saying ""So the lady before you told me blahblahblah about my account..."". And yes, they were referring to our automated phone system/automated voice. 

I heard this so often I was tempted to ask ""You do know it's not a person right??""~~I think we must have had the same caller. Started the call by telling me she's a New Yorker and needs me to be quiet so she can go fast...you know, cuz she's a New Yorker...and then gets mad that I'm not talking...then asked me how long I'd been working there because I sounded new and do I need a glass of water and/or am I drunk?

Hey Gotham, one of your crazies escaped from Arkham.~~When I worked in store, we would often get people coming in to complain that they couldn't ring through to our call centres because they couldn't select options with their phone.

When they got the ""press option 1 for..."" stage, they would use the home button to exit their dialler, re-select the phone icon and in the dialpad, proceed to enter a number before pressing the call button again.

The number of people that did this was astounding.~~I work in a medical lab call center. I had one just this morning, that called to check if we had lab orders on her before she came in to have them drawn, but also felt she needed to tell me her entire medical history, in graphic detail, while she had me... I tend to give them a few minutes to go on, stop acknowledging them after the 2nd time they bulldoze over me, and after I've had a snack and a few sips of my drink (them on mute, of course), I barge my way back in with a ""Excuse me ma'am... ma'am... MA'AM!... I'm so sorry, I have a doctor holding for me on the other line and it's an urgent situation.""  That usually gets rid of them pretty quick.~~I'm in tech support, and people like this kill me. They actively hurt themselves by laying it on so thick like this. Like, i'll go to the mat for customers usually, but come in with all this disrespect and I just start limping instead. Get fucked guy, welcome to the bare minimum.~~I see people call in over multiple days to ask about the eligibility of the same product. Its in the notes, like CALLER asking about PRODUCT, advised it is INELIGIBLE. Why do they think theyll get a different answer when were all reading from the same page about the same policy.~~Best part is today having to listen to a grown man complain for 20 minutes about how he keeps getting late fees and he thinks they should be all credited.

Nope. That is not how it works boss. You have been late consistently. Do you need your billing cycle changed? No? Okay then fees are valid. Do you want automatic payments? No? Then fees are valid. Gtfo.~~I often have people ask to have their doctor's voicemail. ""She doesn't have voicemail, she has me. May I take your message?"" Some people will say no, imagining there will be a time when the doc will answer a randomly ringing phone. Which is like, never. In the history of ever. ~~Just wait until after the call. I get it, we get shitty calls. Shitty people who deserve to be cussed out. But they arent the ones who are gonna suffer if, like this guy, it goes wrong. It might also be that you've been brief here for clarity, but it sounds like this guy was cussing every customer who comes through. Thats just gonna make you a bitter person. At least save it for the really bad ones.~~I 1000% support this and I've done it on several occasions as well. My previous company had a policy not to tolerate those kind of calls. You can give them first warning, saying if they continue with that kind of language, they will be hung up on. More often than not, they continue so they have to call again.

Later on, I figured that those who call just to yell, can actually be used productively. Mute your mic, remove headphones and do something you were unable to finish earlier. They will yell/curse their piece, and then leave. They got it out of their system, you finished job, everyone's a happy panda.~~Brilliant! Yeah, good job that he got you from the sound of it! And I'm glad you were able to help him. Your instructor is dead right, if you stock the product then sure, you sell it just like anything else. 

Must've been hilarious for the spectators tho! I'd love to be a fly on that wall! :D~~I once had a guy call in questioning a monthly $10 charge on one of his lines

I investigated to find out it was a subscription service that sent pictures of teen girls in bikinis to your phone

He asked which line and when I told him he says ""That's my daughter's number!""

 Pretty all he said after that was repeating ""But she's a girl!?!"" over and over

Personally in this case I think this was her way of telling daddy she was gay since as we all know finding scantily clad chicks online for free is not all that difficult...or so I've been told anyway~~",The commenter empathizes with the poster's situation and suggests that the poster should not have given out their personal phone number. They also share a personal experience of dealing with customers who were rude and entitled.
0.0,"My older brother had this moment when we were teenagers. He was enrolled in a med school program when he was 17 (graduated HS early).

Bro: What is EE-MER gen SEE?

Me: .... what?

Bro: EE-MER gen SEE. What is that?

Me: uhhh........ seriously?

Bro: (holds up a packet of ""energy powder"" called emer-gen-c)

Me: (cracks up laughing) You need a different career path.~~Ugh I can empathize. My voicemail says I leave at 4:00 so I have time to finish up my work before I go. I often watch the same phone number call me eight times in a row while I'm ""not there."" Then I listen to the increasingly irate voicemails from the furious customer, mad that I'm not picking up. Bitch my voicemail says I'm gone! Why would you expect an answer? There is literally a team of people who can help you one button-press away but you didn't bother to listen to my voicemail message now did you.~~I work customer service for food delivery and things are being delayed cause many major chains have closed and the local shops are not used to handling the upturn in volume and every day I have people saying well Ive just been waiting since I ordered, I dont care about the virus people having time on their hands is the worst for us, they have time to complain about everything~~I once worked on one end of a 1-800 number that served a lot of elderly callers. There was a 1-900 number were the last 7 digits we're identical to my number. So the only difference in the whole number was the 8/9. Sometimes elderly clients mis-dialed, hung up, and called our number HORRIFIED. Sometimes they felt the need to describe what they'd heard at the first number... Big yikes.~~It's really annoying ""older"" folks say things like that. 10 years ago everyone from neighbors on Facebook to my colleagues through work (15-20 years older than me) were calling millennials flaky and lazy; and I was like, I'm a millennial. I have been working since I was 15. I support a family on my job. Got tired of repeating that too!~~Tommy Lee Jones. Adam Sandler. Anna Nicole. JLaw. Shaq. 

But the worst was Lisa. And by that I mean the most heartbreaking. She called because she needed to take over her husbands account as he had recently passed away. She sounded very young and distraught. It was only halfway through the call when I realized who her husband was. He was on flight 93 and you can listen to the recording if youd like. I took my time with her and took every burden off I could to make it easier. She just didnt want to see his name on the bill anymore. It was rough. ~~I knew a guy in a financial services call center that would constantly mute the phone and scream ""GO KILL YOURSELF!!"" whenever a customer pissed him off.  

Like you, I thought to myself, you slip up just one time and your job, even your career in the industry is *OVER*.  

There have been times working with customers I've gotten so mad I've literally started punching walls the moment the call was done, but never lost my shit like that until the customer was off the phone for the reasons you mentioned.~~"" because Im not able to just hang up. If QA is listening "" this is almost more unsettling to me than the call. Obvious pervert call but you can't hang up because 'reasons' They do realize they are losing money having you listen to this than an actual customer.~~I am repeatedly baffled by peoples complete inability to understand the concept of a wrong number. I mean, I get not wanting to admit to making a mistake, but when the person you reached is not the person you were trying to reach, it doesnt matter who made a mistake*they still cant help you.* Yelling at them will not change that.~~I used to think this kind of response to bad calls would have rendered me jobless within the hour. 

Two years later, and so dejected I barely even registered being alive most days, I dealt with these calls with a simple 'I won't tolerate being spoken to like this. Either you calm down and let me help you, or I terminate this call. Your choice.""

I never used profanity or any kind of detrimental/derogatory terms, but my flatline and disinterested tone was usually enough to drive the point home that the tantrum wasn't going to get any response from me. 9 times out of 10 it de escalated the call. 1 time outta 10, it resulted in a supervisor jumping on the call to parrot what I'm saying for 20 minutes.~~My TL said she overheard me on the phone the other night and she could tell by my stubbornness the customer was clearly being unreasonable, so she listened to the call out of curiousity, and it was basically this. The customer refusing to give mandatory identification info so I could confirm it was his account, and me saying, well I'm not doing anything until you do. She thought it was hilarious because I just did what you did and continued to ask for it despite him freaking out at me. Eventually he went and got it for me but wanted to ""complain"" to my supervisor, who told him I did everything right and in future if he wishes to be helped faster he needs to provide that info. Lol.~~Not exactly the same, but I work as a IT tech, and had reinstalled a PC for a client from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and when she came to pick it up, she asked if she could try to log in to see if it all works.
As you may know, the first time you login to a Windows 10 PC it gives you a lot of welcome messages like ""we are getting everything ready for you blah blah"". She looked at me with a big smile and told me how sweet I was for writing these messages for her, and it made her happy how much work I have put into it. :p~~Been there!!

We have inbound calls from 100's of different clients in the American health care industry and I've had a grocery store clerk who was scanning things while we spoke,  someone changing their baby (I told her I could wait til she was done but insisted it was fine...it was not), someone going through and taking their pills for the day (20+ pills, think ""when are you *gulp gulp* *cough cough cough* open until?*gulp gulp*), parents while they were in a parent-teacher conference at school, and a bunch of cops and EMS workers call in where they have radio convos at the same time.

But I've also been the guy trying to make phone calls in between my own inbound calls lol~~hah, I just had an escalation call like this. 

My IT guy says we need the router to do X

It doesnt

But we neeed it to!

It wont

Maaaaake it doooo it!

I cant

This isnt very good customer service!

Sorry you feel that way. Anything else?

I want a manager!

Im it

Oh. Never mind then~~Damn I've used this line whilst talking to CS once. My telecompany was screwing me over and I was calling them about it - I felt the need to explain to the CS agent that I'm not upset at them, but at the company.
Also made sure not to use ""you"" when referring to the troubles, but the company name instead.

Weird side effect of working in customer service is that I usually end up using my customer service voice when I'm the customer, and try to be as understanding as possible. It's hard to know that the agent actually CAN'T do much more than they already are doing, because company policies are so messy.~~I handle claims and complaints at a call center and we work pretty close with the people handling social media cases.
We once had Matthew Lillard (Shaggy in the live action Scooby Doo movie) roleplay with our social media team on Twitter about lost luggage. People can be quite interesting.~~I've had a call like this where one of our employees called in to talk to HR (who we outsourced) because his manager was giving him grief. Mentioned self-harm and suicide while I was on the phone and then disappeared. We found him eventually, and the manager was fired for a whole mess of stuff but I was a wreck that whole day.~~I HAVE to apologize, even when it's not my fault and they don't wanna accept the fact there's nothing I can do about it.  Even when I have to tell them repeatedly that I can't do anything about their issue.  That's when they ask for a supervisor just to get told the same thing~~Try explaining to people that their 2006 computer isnt going to run their applications they need to work from home and theres nothing I can do to make it so.

OR

Try explaining that I cannot make your computer screen work again over the phone after you dropped it and broke it. No, I cannot work magic no matter how much you say you need it.~~In 9 years this only happened to me twice. I was so shocked the first time a man told me to put one of my male coworkers on the phone. I sat there for a good 30 seconds just silent. Then I put him on hold and called my supervisor to have him tell me what to say. I am so impressed by your reaction! You stayed calm and still helped the sexist customer. You are downright impressive.~~Not in a call center, but I worked Food and Beverage for a resort hotel in Northern Ohio and I once took the drink order and ran drinks for LeBron James and his wife before I realized who I had just interacted with. Nice couple, very friendly. Just wanted some dinner and drinks in our quiet, upscale dining location.~~I sat next to a guy when I worked in a Sprint call center who apparently just gave up and was saying whatever he wanted to the customer on the phone, I was stunned. I heard him saying things like ""No! No! Our system is NOT fucked up!"" and shit like that. It was so crazy. But apparently nobody else heard it and the customer didn't complain, so he continued to work there.~~Hey, I'm just going to put you on a soft hold while I work on this for you, if you need anything, just give me a shout. 


I fucking looooved my soft hold. Presented the right way, it becomes a form of extra customer service. Really I just hated the small talk, and saw no reason to increase my hold time.

-

It's hilarious you were able to call them out.~~yeah; I started doing this actually, if they are rude I am cold and short and just get straight to the point; I don't even acknowledge apologizes from rude ass customers after helping them. Silence is the best weapon cause entitled assholes can't handle being ignored. I agree with this method.~~My husband had a coworker in auto insurance go out the same way. She was in his new hire team and always was a little rough around the edges for an already pretty lax corporate environment. Just a little too much swearing and raunch. She didn't quiet have the infinite patience required for a call center. 

One day some lady was screaming at her about some genuine mistake our company had made, and she turns around and yells from one end of the cubicle section to the other where the sup sits ""CAN SOMEONE HELP ME GET THIS FUCKING BITCH OFF MY LINE!?""

The mute button had not worked.

She was immediately fired.~~","The commenter shares a personal experience of receiving angry voicemails from their older brother, who was enrolled in a med school program at the time.

0.0,"I never understand ranting at call centre people.

1. Everyone knows by now you guys have not much power
2. Half the time you possibly hate the company as much as I do in that moment.
3. If Im nice, theres a non zero chance you can actually go outside your real role and get it fixed. So I need you to like me because if my problem is complex Ill probably screw your metrics.

Moral: The best strategy is being super nice to the call centre people when you have an issue. Its possible to hate the company and not the minions.

Caveat: If youre calling about a fake car accident Im absolutely gonna have fun with you, sorry but that business youre in is bullshit.~~I have a guy who calls everyday lucky for me its a big company so I only get him every 3 months or so. He tells a creepy story about how his daddy took him to the mechanic shop and he would go up in the lift with his daddy etc. All the while hes whispering and honestly his dedication to calling every day makes me feel he's a genuine creep who is probably on a list of some kind. Then after he tells his story he insists we roll play he said ""I'll be your daddy"" that's when he was cold transferred to a supervisor ~~","The commenter doesn't understand why people rant at call center employees, as they know they have limited power and don't have the ability to fix complex issues. They suggest being nice to the call center employees when dealing with an issue, as it's possible to hate the company and not"
1.0,"Yeah.  People just don't care to watch their money when they are so used to complaining to get refunds.

I still remember the younger lady I had years ago on a brand spankin new account.  She opened it with $400.  Not too long after opening she called because she was getting overdraft notices, and she just couldn't understand how she could have overdrawn the account.

""Well, you spent 250 at Walmart, 300 at Circuit City, 150, at Target, and wrote a check for $300.""

""Yes, I realize that, but none of those were over $400, so how could I be overdrawn""

Now, the bank I worked as a CSR for had some extremely dirty practices, but that was 100% on the lady.~~Hey, its not about you, I promise. Its so hard when people take out their fear and pain on you, but I promise you they are just scared people trying to push that emotion away onto whoever will take it. Dont take it, it isnt yours. Youre doing your best and I bet your best is great.~~As someone that works at a dealership, I am convinced that people's IQs drop drastically the second they walk into or have any interaction with a dealership or its personnel. I've lost track of the number of people I have spoken with that think they make their monthly payment directly to the dealership.~~I work at a bank too and I was talking to someone who wanted to have fees reversed. Our process is to waive the fees if they qualify and explain how to avoid them in the future. So as I'm talking to him he's like ""I don't need you to talk or say anything, just do as I say and waive the fees."" It was honestly so fucking rude and it made feel like subhuman garbage. Our bank expects us to waive the fees just to keep members happy and avoid further escalations. So I just waived the fees and took a break. But I honestly hope that dude, wherever he is, go fucks himself for being a huge piece of shit.~~I feel like this guy is just a textbook example of an idiot. I mean, he has a card with auto insurance, but doesn't use it to rent the car. He forgets where the car is parked, and can't figure out how to find it. And he calls a bank that is now unrelated to the car, and expects them to fix the situation.~~I really wish you had added one word to the answer. ""Your"".  Because sir, your money is literally the last thing I will care about during a catastrophe. 

What a ridiculous question.  Like it's good to know if a financial institution has contingency plans, but dangit, pick a scenario that actually could happen.~~This woman is delusional .. no bank is going to issue her a credit card that she pays off once a year at tax time... things just don't work like that. 

And when she refuses to pay at least the minimum for the next 5 months to be fair if she gets her tax refund in march most banks aren't going to look very favorable at that. But I imagine she's paying through the nose with high interest rate cards because no responsible bank is going to put up with her bullshit~~Honestly my favorite people are the people who threaten to sue. We have a strict policy if someone has obtain legal, we cant speak to them. 99% of people who say they will sue us I respond with Im sorry have you obtained a lawyer? And pretty much all of them bold faced lie thinking that will get them somewhere and say yes and I get to say I understand, I apologize if youve obtained a lawyer Im not able to speak with you. You can send your request in writing and someone from our legal team will follow up they all try to backtrack, but once you say it you cant take it back sorry! Lol~~My credit card got hacked/stolen/shenaniganed during lockdown. The bank lobbies were closed, and Fed Ex wasnt an option. The person I spoke with was so kind. I was anxious because I basically HAD to quarantine because of extreme high risk, and everything was connected to that one and only credit card. 7-10 days was gonna be hard.

The lady put me on hold for a minute, then asked if I could get to the main branch. I could, so she told me to park out front, dial this number and that person would bring it out to me, fully protected. I cried then, and again when this sweet lady came out in mask, shield, and gloves, with my new card.~~I used to work for the mental health branch of an insurance company, and people who would call in to check on claims without wanting to give even names and DOBs... it sucked. They'd always say stuff like ""I'm at my office!"" or ""I'm on the subway!"" and I mean... that sucks for you, but why are you calling your insurance company to ask for personal information if you're somewhere you won't even give your name and DOB? And maybe have your insurance card on you when you call in so you can give me that ID number instead of your social, because I'm going to  need ONE of those pieces of information.

I feel for you. ~~I kind of wish there was more education outreach for elders when it comes to scams like this. Some kind of PSA they could watch. No your grandchild is not in jail, your computer hasn't been hacked, no one from the IRS is calling, etc. This happens way too often.~~Oh, I got something similar to this recently. Somebody phoned up, they quickly decided I couldn't help them (though I was willing to try my best), they talked for a long time, and they rejected all of my suggestions to try to help them.

Then, 15 minutes into the call, they complained that they were paying for a carer for their mother so they could call us and that the amount they had to pay increased the longer they were on the call with me, so seeing as I couldn't help them then they would need to end the call. Then they complained and rejected my suggestions for a further 5 minutes before they went silent and then hung up.~~I love the line at the end No youre not youre withdrawing 155. 

I work at a support center and we emergency support on the weekends. We charge an hourly rate for that and customers are alerted three times that if they go forward to a technician they will be billed. I cannot tell you how many times I get a call and the first thing I hear is Im not paying $200 for help. 

My response always is  No, youre not your paying $285

Oh so satisfying. ~~I once had a woman call super angry saying how dare we tell her that the document she submitted was illegal, she was getting so worked up I could pretty much hear her shaking. While she was going on I pulled up the email she was referring to. 

The word was illegible.

Edit: um omg? My first award! Thank you kind stranger!~~My late MIL was scammed every month out of $900 for health insurance.  She had Medicare and a full HMO supplemental.  She was getting dementia and was an easy con.  We got the money refunded by the bank but they kept calling.  I answered the phone one day and they pretended to be a detective from the bank and were going to get her money back for her but they just needed to talk to her.  I told them she had dementia and was in a care facility.  Oh, but they just needed to talk to her.  At this point we had control of her finances so they couldn't get anymore money but before that, it's so frightening when you know someone isn't disabled enough to have no rights but still can be so taken advantage of.~~I once spent an hour on the phone with someone who paid their bill, called in a day later and asked us to move the payment to another account. Was now calling backing because she had a late fee for the bill that she paid and then moved the money to another account...

A lot of explaining that she only paid us $50. So how could she have paid off 2 $50 bills~~Over in /r/talesfromtechsupport there have been posts where it is evident that the person with the problem has no idea how anything on a computer works. Doesn't know where the power on/off button is, keeps saying the monitor is the computer, insists they are on an Apple product when everything screen indicates they are using Windows.

There are times where the quip is made ""Clearly you are unable to use a computer. Someone will be coming by your desk to remove the equipment and leave you with a tablet of paper and some pencils.""~~Due to work related circumstances I have been at the DMV (Dept of Motor Vehicles) 7 times in the past 2 months &amp; on about half those occasions I overhear this convo between a customer and an employee:

DMV : You are missing a signature for person X on this paperwork, you should run out to the car and get them to sign it. I'll call you again in a couple minutes  

Person: But they are at home.

DMV: (slightly more emphasis)  No, I'm pretty sure they are waiting in the car

Person: I think I know where they are

DMV: (More emphasis) Have you checked the car? They are waiting in there.

Person: but..... (light dawns)  oh yeah!  They ARE in the car.  I'll be right back.~~Omg I feel this today

Me: I'm going to connect you to X to serve your needs, is there anything else I can help you with before I connect you?

Customer: well, *tangent about other issue that will be resolved by talking to X*

Me: Ma'am, I have X standing by for transfer to you to help you.

Customer: ...

Me: Ma'am would you like for me to transfer X to you?

Customer: well I really need someone to help me~~I used to love that. You can speak with me (a supervisor) or my boss (manager) or their boss (senior manager) or their boss (site director who doesnt take calls and has no idea on how to help you) and thats it. The higher you go up the chain the less knowledge they have on actually processing calls and resolving your issue. Hell most times youre better off talking to the first person, you know the persons who job it is to actually take calls. ~~I do love the ""threats"" of losing a customer. That's fair, there are so many companies for every service. But, you may need to actually speak to a special department that will ask why you're leaving and maybe offer a special to keep your service. Not because we *want* you, just your money. Your loyalty means nothing, as long as you pay within a decent time thats all we want.~~&gt;Karen: I don't have that either. Why do you even need all this info? Just pull up the account!

Like come on this is your livelihood here and you wait until the day you move to call? You can schedule a move up to 30 days before and I can see the notes where an agent told her that and she said she didn't have time and would do it later. The agent also sent her a email on how to do it online. Well I guess she has nothing but time now. I don't know any company's that do same day installations.~~I truly hope you never have to deal with a similar call, but if you do, I wonder if it would help when they say, I paid for it with my card! to say, Actually, when you swiped your card, you authorized us to pay for it on your behalf. So far, no money has left any bank account of yours, so you havent paid for anything yet. We are the ones who gave money to the store, and now you need to pay us back.

Edit: Thank you for the gold!~~Im good with computers.  Made me think of one customer I was helping with tech support. He said this isnt working blah blah blah. I try basic troubleshooting and hes like Im a doctor I know what Im doing.  Finally it dawned on me and I asked is the device on? I heard him go GODDAMNIT! And he hung up.~~I talked to a sweet older gentleman today and he was doing just fine with everything, until I said, ""now enter your card # on your keypad and then hit pound"", (for your payment).  I heard some clicking and I thought ummm, that doesn't sound right and about the same time I realized that sounded like a keyboard, not his phone keypad.  I didn't miss a beat because I didn't want to embarrass him and I just said, let's try again and please use your keypad on your phone.    All went well that time.

Wahhhwahh.  You got to pay to play.~~I dont negotiate with verbal abuse, thats an immediate hang up on my end. I also let my supervisor and manager know, as our customers tend to reach out directly to the CEO, company president, or make obnoxious social media rants. Sadly, by the time its gotten that elevated, senior staff gives into their demands to save face. Cool, so I ate shit following our SOP but if someone makes enough noise then well make an exception for them.~~What's worse, I once had a hard working young lady call in. I'll never forget this she had about 10k in her account and called in the card wasn't working.  So i look at the account and see a levy came in for 43,000 for back child support for the joint account holder. She had just added the boyfriend, none of the money was his and he never told her about his troubles. That was an expensive lesson for her to learn. Surprisingly she took it well enough it was only as she hung up that I heard her start crying.  That must have been 5-6 years ago and its stuck with me.~~Meanwhile, their lost card is still active and possibly compromised, and they can now potentially be held liable for any fraudulent activity as theyve decided not to shut it down. Because a customer service agent that she called of her own volition just wants to steal her information/identity in particular. Dumb. ~~Yup I had this a few times in credit card customer service

Customer :  what are all these XBOX charges?! 

Me : is it at all possible that someone in your household might have bought games using your card? 

Customer : ooooooh that little asshole, I'd better check

Always made me laugh lol~~When I worked for a bank call center about 15 years ago, I got so many calls from wives wanting to know what a charge listed as GGW  was on their credit card or bank statement. I would have to explain to them that it was a subscription to an adult video service that was pretty popular at that time and was advertised late night on most every TV channel. Almost every time they would say, oh, then you could hear them start to shout as they hung up the phone. ~~Worked at a place who did credit cards with very low limits. A lot of times these were peoples first cards or just for people who got into credit trouble before. Problem is that if you use them at Fast Food places or similar for your first couple of purchases they would deactive. Often leaving people with a bag of food and no money to pay for it. 

This is for security. You could steal the card in the mail and use it, while the security cameras, if any, would only take a pic of your car. Lots of angry people.~~So, they wouldn't have taken the balance transfer with no interest, unless they could also make new charges for no interest?

I guess that is commitment? of some kind?  Save a ton, or keep paying interest on both the balance and on any new charges.  This option to save just a middle amount, is apparently just not worth their time.~~Yep. Had one calling in looking to get a new phone. They were using a smart phone on their grandma's account. So, he called in and was saying he wanted off the account and a new phone. Okay, told him we needed his grandmas permission to move him over and he had to be over 18. 

At this point he flipped out. Threated to throw his phone in the garbage and walk away from the account. Which does nothing, as we will still bill his Grandma every month to the contract is up. I gave him his options, get his grandma to call in, giving us permission to take him off the account and then if he walks into any store and show his id he should be good. Might have to pay a fee based on credit history, etc. 

Cue ten minutes of him swearing and yelling at me. I remember the phone he was sick of was better then the phone I had... Fun times.~~Ive had customers like that.  

My suggestion: once you ask if he needs anything else and he asks a non-business related question, give the shortest answer you can and do whatever your closing dialogue is, without pause for him to be able to start talking again.

I like (state) just fine, thanks and thank you for calling (company)have a great day!

That way - even if your call gets reviewed by someone not in the know, you can say you presumed he was done as he didnt ask another account related question.~~I have a bill

Ok, how can I help?

Ok, would you like to make a payment?

No, you sent me a bill

Ok, how can I help with that?

Screaming internally are you trying to tell me youre an effing duck? What do you need from me?!?~~I had one guy at the end of the call ask me to send him the recording of the conversation. He got mad when I told him we couldn't do that. He proceeded to say it was his property and would sue if he didnt get it. Nothing happened of course but still.. some people dont understand the call center world I guess.~~I'm sorry you had to put up with that. Some customers get an idea in their head, and it becomes their reality, and because they think being wrong is a sign of weakness, just deny deny deny. 

It's annoying, and sometimes they're just making shit up (liars love to call others liars). I know it's a ""oh wow, thanks I'm cured"" thing, but don't let those people get to you. You're not doing anything wrong. You're telling them the facts. If they don't like the facts, then that's their problem. No matter what they say about you, they're the one whose having trouble with reality. Not you.~~In that situation just briefly explain then disconnect. Something like ""I'm very sorry but there it's a fire alarm / earthquake / whatever I need to hang up and evacuate the building, please call us back later"" and hang up without waiting for a response.

If you do want parking, membership B comes with complimentary parking! But is a bit more expensive because of that.

Ill buy membership A. Its cheaper after all and I drive there everyday so the complimentary parking permit would really help. 

Do you mean membership B? Because membership A does not have a parking permit included. Or shall I also set up a parking permit for x amount extra? 

Why would I pay x amount extra when parking is complimentary with membership A?

(Lucky the wife was there to set this man straight.)~~I swear the selective hearing customers have drives me bonkers.

I open every call confirming company name, my name and then asking for their name.

While some will give, more often they give address, account number, query and only eventually get to name after I ask possibly a third time (Yes, you are calling for Mr X, but what is your name?!)~~You don't ruin their day. They do.

One time, when I was on closing (12 PM to 9 PM) I was on a call for about THREE HOURS. I can't remember all that went on as it was almost a year ago, but just a lot of questions, and a lot of repeat questions, then clarifying questions, and repeating answers to other people that were in the room, etc etc etc. I eventually get off the phone and log out at 11:30 PM.

I ended up having the same woman twice and the second time when I said her name and then guess who she went NO IT ISNT. It was too funny.~~Where I work we quit asking for any SSN... even the last 4. We changed all of our protocols to verify, we will not do anything if you do not have your account number, we will tell you where it can be found, if you dont have any of that you have to come into a branch to request it.
We also only ask Name, Address, DOB, and mothers maiden name. We also call them back on a phone number thats listed on their account because of spoofed calls. ~~I worked for a retail store a few years back and had a guy in his 30s walk in and try to buy $3000 in gift cards. He was on the phone with someone the entire time too. We told him we can only give him up to $2000 in gift cards as that was the daily limit. He was enraged and blamed us for having to go somewhere else for the rest and we stated that no legitimate company would get you to pay them in gift cards he cussed us out and left the store.

It's a shame they're so rare.~~""I'm sorry mam. I'm not transferring you to a supervisor as the credit bureau is a separate company. It's there anything else I can help you with?"" Would be my response. And if they refused to get off the line I would inform a supervisor of the stupid request incase she called back.


But then again that depends on management having your back which I assume they don't~~As someone who has been the victim of credit card fraud, I salute you for your efforts. My favorite conversation went like this:

Hello, this is smol banks fraud department. We have a charge on your account that seems questionable. Are you currently in Panama !

The city in Florida ? No.

No, the country in Central America with the canal.

Never.

Okay, we will take care of this then ! Your new card will be sent to your mailing address at (my address) in three business days. Your current card ending in (reads numbers) is now deactivated.

Bus driver decided not to cave in to her shit. Took a lot of arguing and a passenger removing her phone from her to get her off the bus. Followed by another 10minutes of her refusing to let the bus doors shut...

So yes, definitely wanted to slap one!~~We work the deceased end of CC collections and hear this all the time. Family are upset that their loved one was able to get a CC and charge it up. Upon reviewing the statements, most of the charges are for medicine and food - the only way some of our elderly cardholders can afford to live is to use what they are provided by SSI and charge the rest. 

I get that no one wants to see their loved ones in debt but some have no choice. ~~Man oh man. I got a call where the guy immediately said ""I'm recording this call"" and I was like ""(ope) Sir, all our calls are recorded."" And he went into this NONSENSICAL RANT about how we stole from him. We're a utility company and he claimed that trying to upgrade his meter was theft. Like dude. The meter is ours and I don't get paid enough for this. I put him on hold to ""investigate"" and went straight to a supervisor lmao We pulled all our equipment from his property after he released his dogs and pulled a shotgun on our employees + police officers. A double felony right there. Karma is a bitch~~A spouse calling frantically about a joint account will always be some of my worst memories. 

Especially when they called asking to remove the other party but keep the account active because it's their main account. You can't remove a joint account holder without both going into the branch which wasn't an option in these circumstances. Luckily at that bank only one account holder needs to go to the branch to close the account however. If they needed more immediate remedies we could change the account security to both parties needing sign off like that account seemed to be set up. 

Never add someone to your existing account as a joint account holder. If you're going to have one, open a new account together and still maintain separate ones even if you don't plan on using them as your main account.~~$10,000 is a lot to me, but is it really that much in the banking world? I used to work for someone who was transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars every few days for business ventures, charity, etc. A friend who worked in banking said these are the types banks really bend over backwards to keep.~~My guess:

Your money exists as a digital record that ""Person X has Y dollars saved"", probably at one or more data centers located...  somewhere. There are probably backups. If the bank gets nuked, at some point skmeone checks the backups and tells youvhoq muh money you have. If the bank goes under because of the fact, theres the federal bank insurance program... thing.~~I hate those calls. The people who become that way aren't thinking straight at all. They're panicking trying to work out what they need to do and thinking of a million things at once.  And you can't reason with them because *their* state of mind won't allow it. 

I get that it leaves you feeling like shit but it's one of those times where you really couldn't do anything. You're not shit a shit person, you're not shit at your job, you're just a person who trying to do their best through this shitty time. 

I hope your next week/shift/whatever is better.~~I hate those calls.  Back after 2016 election I had someone disputing a trump campaign charge that was reoccurring even though it wasn't supposed to (shocking!) Back then we could put a stop pay (essentially a block) on the merchant and I couldn't resist i told the guy, ""so what I've done is put a wall around your account so the charge can't get in"".  It was maybe my 5th dispute of the day on those charges and I couldn't help myself.  

TOTaLlY random question... every time I get a transfer from one of my colleagues in the Philippines, now that everyone is working from home, I keep hearing roosters.  How many roosters are in the Philippines because my guess from how often I hear them is they must make up like 90% of the country.... Nothing bad or anything (I'd much rather have roosters than trump supporters!), just curious.~~Are you from the US because this is very different than my experience in the UK.

I don't mean the rudeness or not answering questions because there is no excuse for that I mean how the system works.

I've had my card blocked before on an online transaction and when I speak to the fraud team they ask if  I spent ""1024 at online electrical store""  and I say yes I did. So then they unblock it and them tell me to try again in so many minutes or even wait to make sure it goes through.

Your system sounds like it will just block it again and again even if they confirm it?~~I don't work at a call center, Im a bank teller, I just lurk here. This reminds me of the time I got a call at work and this chick was so angry she said to me, (this is a direct quote, I wrote it down I was so flummoxed) ""yeah I was just wondering why my balance is never a consistent number?"" I im'd a coworker like, ""quick how do I explain to a customer that she spends and makes money?!?!"" I think I ended up explaining pending transactions and she seemed fine with that explanation, but there was a very long awkward silence before that.~~I think you did the right thing. I had a call just this morning from a lady asking for something to be collected (I won't say what, because it'll make it obvious where I work) and she said that it wasn't finished, but her husband had just died so he wouldn't be needing it any more. This was my first call of the day and I felt so bad for her. She started crying and I didn't know what to do. I tried to be sympathetic and get her all the info she needed before she had to ask, and only ask for the minimum details from her. I also marked her husband's account so we wouldn't send any letters addressed to him. I never really know what to do in those situations.~~Not me but a few colleagues have had things like ""I want to remove this charge for ""insert unseemly service here"" and more recently ""I want to close my account so payment to (unseemly service) doesn't show"" (couldn't due to pending payment) we are not a bank but a large online payment processor colloquially known as ""spend friend""~~",The commenter shares a personal experience of being on the phone for three hours with a customer who acted entitled and refused to take responsibility for their actions.

1.0,"I had a mother call me one time to request we send her 20 yr old daughters medical bills in her name not daughters name because she pays all her daughters bills since shes in school. I told her per HIPAA that is not possible because the daughter is a legal adult and once a person turns 18 they are liable for all their finances. Mom LOST it. Told me I sounded stupid and ridiculous. No matter how I spun it she wouldnt budge and asked for a supervisor. Supervisor told her the same things and went round and round with her for an hour! She called back two hours later and the coworker behind me got her and was dealing with her for an hour and transferred to a supervisor. That supervisor shut her down real quick and told point blank per HIPAA it wasnt going to happen and pulled up HIPAA law and read it to her. Mom still wasnt happy.~~Trying to verify identity through email is even more of a pain.

So, they actually give a crap about that there?

I know in the US nobody gives a damn if you have pirated software, unless you're doing it on literally a corporate/organizational level.  If you've got a pirated game, nobody cares. . .if your entire company has something pirated, then the company behind that thing will probably get irate.~~Last I checked, not paying your bills is not exclusive to any one race, so I fail to see how 'racism' comes into play here. If a white person had had her same info and payment history, they'd have been declined too. Just because she isn't hearing what she wants to hear doesn't make it racist.~~Im sorry you had to go through this. I once had a client completely lose his mind because I was asking him security questions like full name, DOB, etc.

I said if you keep swearing at me Im going to have to disconnect the call, and he just kept going. Just as I pressed the disconnect button I heard him scream fa***t into the phone.

Unfortunately with our system theres no wrap time after outbound calls, so I immediately got an inbound call that I had to deal with before I could get off and go have a wee cry.

Edit: it wasnt even what he said that upset me, Ive been called far worse by far more unpleasant people, it was just that he was so goddamn irrational about it.~~My biggest pet peeve is when they give it in groups of two, but not with individual numbers, instead like ""fourty-seven, thirty six, twenty-one, fifty-six"" and they'll always trip me up because 13-19 always makes me think they're about to give a 30-90 number and now I have to backspace it, re-enter it, and at the same time decipher what numbers you are giving me next.~~If this is all that happened., they still have access to the computer due to malware they installed.

They only have to wait untill she checks for the 14,000, grab her passwords and then transfer that and everything else from all her accounts. She'll have nothing, and there is no good ending.~~I just had a customer get confused while I was paraphrasing what he said in the beginning of the call.

I text boss while giving customer a general company email address, then hang up the phone. Boss replies a while later with ""Did he spell companyname?""   
This is partially my fault. The company name is not intuitive, I never thought I would need to spell it for him. I do give spelling to people who ask, but if they don't ask, I assume they have the capability to look at the unit they own to get the spelling.~~I dont know why people dont understand this. I have a similar story, where an account opening associate reached out for advice and said he didnt feel it was ethical to issue a card to a mentally disabled person. Of course my response was that it wasnt ethical to discriminate. 

Sure, its someones responsibility to provide guidance and education to the applicant, but legally all they have to do is sign a piece of paper and meet minimum credit requirements. ~~The amount of times i have to tell mrs Smith she's not allowed to call for mr Smith is staggering. No i won't commit fraud because mr Smith can't be bothered to call on his own dang stuff he signed up for. I will however notate the account that y'all are sketchy as hell~~I used to get that with car insurance.  In Florida there's a specific coverage (pita is what it is) that you have to sign additional forms for.  If people were semi-computer literate it was easy but people who didn't want to take the time or effort or frankly some of the elderly (but I understand them having issues) it would turn into a nightmare!!! 45+ min calls, multiple emails/faxs, screaming about why the rate is different, why they have to sign the forms etc.  I got asked so many times to sign the forms for the policyholder.  Yeah, not happening.  It's part of the coverage contract that *they* have to read and agree to. Smh

Shut him up fast~~I've only gotten overdraft fees exactly twice. Both due to unauthorized transactions ( someone tried to eBay with my account ).

He refers to her as his wife, but different last name, which isnt that uncommon, so I didnt even question it at first.  Then he wants to send it to a different address, which to prevent fraud, we do extra verification and he passes without issue.  Then he starts asking if her name might appear on the bill and gets all funny about it showing up within the bill.  Then he refers to her as his girlfriend and realizes he tripped up and was like oh, I mean, well, were engaged.  It was pretty obvious this card was going to the mistress and I just hope the wife opens the bill one day and sees her name.~~Thats why I only give my kid Xbox cards or a pre-paid Visa to buy things. Its slightly more time consuming to have to go on Amazon and buy a digital card, but at least that way theres no potential for him to accidentally purchase more than we agreed upon.~~&gt;Why do people accuse me of lying?

Because they are lying in order to achieve a desired result, and/or avoid negative consequences for their poor behavior. He doesn't want to say ""I am incompetent because I made a mistake and refuse to acknowledge it or correct it"" on a recorded line. Everyone can make a mistake but antagonizing the person who has the ability to help him is not going to fix anything.

Quarterly bills are every THREE months, not four. Even though a quarter is 1/4.

If you take out a loan to buy a house, you have to pay the bank back that loaned it to you. You took out a loan to buy clothes, now you owe the cc company that loaned you the money. I mean... Wtf?!~~I hate when people keep repeating the same crap at you because they think you aren't listening. I had this guy on yesterday afternoon and he must have said the same thing to me like 4 times. It got to the point where I said 'you've told me this 4 times already' and he was like 'I just want to stress the importance of what I'm saying'. I'm not an idiot. I get it. I will do what I've said I will do. Stop wasting my time.~~I used to work for a major bank and we did funds verification all the time. We're not even allowed to advise customers on things like that. The most we can do is tell customers not to give their bank login details to anyone and to be careful who they give their social to.  What a dumbass.~~I work general customer service. Today I had the same situation with an account being closed due to 4 months nonpayment. The lady asked me how it was fair if her previous payment history was good. Well it *was* good. Until it wasn't. You can have the most impeccable credit in the world, but you stop paying and responding to our communications and you reap what you sew.
  
She was also furious that we couldn't reinstate her account now that she was caught up 5 months later. Apparently we should know better because of her previous history and credit and not treat her like the risk she was. She also admitted to not paying any of her bills during that time and being furious because everyone closed her accounts.~~I work for a call center for a major retailer and gift card scams are a big issue.  It's sad that some people are so gullible and they don't realize that if you buy gift cards and you scratch that pin off and give the scammer the numbers, you are SOL and your money is gone and you aren't going to get it back.  I've talked to people who have given scammers thousands and thousands of dollars and are left with nothing and they have no recourse.   I talked to one elderly man who had purchased the max amt of gift cards that they would let him purchase at one store and then got in his car and drove to another two stores to purchase more.~~Recently I was taking inbound calls (I usually make outbound calls and I work for a financial institution).

I handle everything to do with credit cards.

Had some crazy guy call and when I asked him for some personal information he says How do I know Im speaking to (company)??

I told him Well you called us. You called the customer service number on the back of your card

Then he goes on a rant about how that stuff can be faked.

*headdesk*

Some people are too paranoid.~~Everyone is overlooking the unsung victim in this scenario, the Air BNB owner that gets a $35 kick in the nuts just because this tool decided to protest non fraudulent charges. Many people don't know that if you dispute a charge (even if the charge ends up being called by your own admission after the fact) the retailer has to pay a charge just to have it looked into.~~Texas resident here - quite a few years back there were so many complaints about child support money ""going missing"". This either due to the payor just not making the payments or the payee lying about whether they received the money (or not). Since the laws prior to being changed were that child support was a civil matter one side or the other had to get lawyers involved, file lawsuits and still not have a just resolution.

So the state changed the laws. Now the payor sends the child support money to the state and the state pays the recipient. It also means that failure to pay child support niw becomes a criminal matter and, as the couple in the post found, the state can and will file garnishments on any assets it can get its hands on.~~If it really was his friend that made the purchase (which I doubt) then if he gave access to the card to the friend, he would have done it knowing what kind of person his friend was. And if he didn't make it clear that purchases were to only be with permission and that anything else would have to be paid back, that's his fault.~~I use to work for cellphone company and I had maybe one person in the seven years I worked there request not to be recorded. We had to advise them that the calls were recorded for quality purposes only. However, if the call was being reviewed or if the call was being listened to live, that the person would stop reviewing the call. Which was true. 

They seemed to be ok with that as they continued with the call.~~Sir, keeping track of all of that is called being an adult. You have to deal with it. And because you have gotten abusive, I'm ending this call. Bye! *Then continues notating the account, giving his specific abuse, what was wanted, and his lack of want of being an adult.*~~I had to deal with a customer recently who INSISTED the last time he had an issue the previous agent sent a text message to the CEO and thought I could do the same.

This is a company that's profits are in the BILLIONS of dollars and he wanted me to send a text message to the CEO, because he wanted a free phone without increasing his bill above $33 a month.

He threatened to quit over the whole thing but honestly, if he feels that way, see you, I'm sure the company will miss his $33 a month... ~~I'm astonished at the number of idiots who don't understand simple things about how Banks work. Maybe OP needs to add an addendum to explain:

1. To pull up a customers account, I specifically need the CC number or SSN. I can't even put eyes on the account without that info. Which means I obviously can't just cancel the card for her.

2. To protect customer privacy and finances, information that is EASILY OBTAINABLE and COMMONLY GIVEN OUT and may even be PUBLIC such as name, address, phone number and date of birth is not enough to be able to do ANY CHANGES in a customer account.

Use your brains people. How much of that info do your friends, family, coworkers, neighbors etc already have? How hard would it be for them to get any missing pieces? 

For cable, sure that information should be good enough for whatever.  But your MONEY?!~~I nearly clicked the down vote option because John Smith from Queens New York is disgusting. Then realised that's the opposite of what I should do because that would just be further punishment for having to deal with a creep like that! 

Maybe if he's reported enough he can be fired as a customer and his number can be blocked. I mean, probably hard to do but we can dream.

Edit : costumer to customer~~I think I talked to Mr Swearypants today too. He opened the call cussing and yelling. So I said ""I'll be happy to help you if you can provide me the information I requested. I cannot help you if you continue swearing at me.""

He starts on a tirade about my ""education level""... ??

I said ""Yeah, I'm sure MY education level is the problem here. *click*"" 

Idc if they fire me. I've been verbally abused by ""customers"" for 14 years and I'm not accepting it any more ~~Working in alarm dispatch, I love it when customers call in and don't know their password. I've had people try to give me their SSN and pretty much anything else I would need to open a line of credit in their name, but all I can take is the password that they chose in the first place.

It's even better that at night I'm the boss, and if they want to talk to my boss the answer is ""I would need your password for that.""~~GPRD brought my old job so many funny calls...

""You keep calling and emailing offering me shit and I cancelled my account with you, I want you to delete my data.""

""Sure thing, sir. Can I have your full name?""

""No.""

""National ID number?""

""No.""

""Phone number?""

""No.""

""How do you expect me to delete your data if I don't know who you are, sir?""~~I'm... furiously envious.

&gt; if you want me to assist you Im going to need you to watch your tone.

Knowing my TL, he'd chastise me for this for borderline rudeness / *too* direct.  

&gt; I found that account and noted it and told my manager what happened and she called him to tell him he cant speak that way to us

Tfw your TL is *actually understanding and supportive* of their underlings (not 100% a customer lapdog).~~Was Power of Attorney for my father for a couple years before he passed.  And I truly never minded filling out the forms, but what always got me was the supervisor/manager/underwriter/fraud dept/compliance  officer/corporate officer who would kick stuff back because of 'a typo in the name'.

My dad and I have the same first/last name but different middle names 'Bill H Smith' and 'Bill A Smith'.

And while no one had a problem with the POA, they all saw dad's name and my signature, with the 'A' instead of 'H' and assumed it was a typo somewhere.  Never got mad about it, nice to know folks are watching out, but it did get exasperating sometimes.~~I work for a bank and recieved an automated call from ""Amazon"" to verify some high dollar transactions. I almost connected through, I realized it was strange the number was a local number, then checked my amazon account and finally had to ignore the calls for a few days.

I work for a bank and they almost hooked me into talking to them.

And like you have had many calls like yours where they ignore your advice make it worse and come back with claims you told them to follow the scammers instructions. I can't tell you how many times I have had to review calls and call back customers and be nice to people who lied and tried to throw someone else under the bus for thier stupidity.~~",The commenter worked at a large American bank and had a fire alarm go off in their office.

Its like in their mind they think they still have some sort of time to do this but in reality theyre just shooting themselves in the foot for waiting so long.~~If you want to talk to someone really high up, ask the person on the phone for their email address. Assuming they work for the same company as the COO or CEO, you should have the email format

FirstNameLastName@company.com...FirstName.LastName@company.com, FIMILastName@company.com...you get the idea.

Then find out the names of the executive staff and email away. Granted their emails are most likely read by admin assistants. 

My dad has managed to talk to a CEO and a VP of something on two different occasions...The CEO was actually pretty pissed that this was happening with deliveries and ended up getting a fairly expensive piece of furniture for free. 

FYI: this was after many attempts with customer service and they weren't helpful. ~~I worked in a department for a big bank that completed credit references...the supplier was opening a line of credit or a Collect on Delivery type of account with the banks customer and they wanted to make sure that our mutual customer had a good credit standing at our bank. The ONLY way we would release general information about their accounts was if the business supplied a valid customer signature. We usually completed about 75-100 requests per day. A good 10-15% were sent back because they didnt have a signature or the one sent was bad.~~I work for a bank and constantly hear ""I'll just close my accounts and take my money elsewhere."" To which I reply ""I understand your frustration, is there anything I can do to assist with closing those accounts today?"" 

I'm only required to provide empathy and support. I'm not required to retain customers.~~I've been doing tech support for a long time now and I'm never surprised with the amount of bs and stupidity. Had a cm tell me his computer was Outlook and if I was not familiar with an Outlook computer I should be fired. I've had people leave the login recovery process because they wanted to check Facebook and it was my fault they had to restart the process. They want to get electronic statements but they don't want to give us an email or phone number.   People wanting to change their cell phone plan on the credit card website, cant to it call your cell provider its a different, cm say but ibpay you you can do this you just don't want to help.....~~Ditto on the Am Ex cards, and they have the four digit code instead of three. 

We are not allowed to read them back. Its strange though because everyone in the department takes credit card numbers. I guess its because outside contractors or vendors  could be in hearing range? Idk. 

The supervisors being able to go back and listen has saved my dyslexic butt from having to make awkward call backs a few times though. ~~Years ago, I had a dude try to use his ""debit card"" as a primary ID at the bank. He was holding a credit card. I told him he gave me his credit card and asked for a different ID (credit card couldn't be primary ID). This man argued with me for 5-10 minutes saying that he was going to talk to my supervisor because I couldn't tell the difference between a debit and credit card. I had to tell him to read what the front of the card said before he believed me.  

Edit: spelling~~In the era of scam callers I can understand the concern of giving out important information over the phone.   


We are recently being hit by a new form, they are filtering the calls through known numbers, so now I am receiving calls from people calling me a scammer.  or the  Wangiri scam, where they ring once, so you call back only to be put on hold. and your phone is charged a lot. 

The ""tax office"" will call and tell you that you have to transfer money, or ""centrelink"" (our welfare) will call and ask for your CRN (similar to SSN) so no I would not give my CRN out to anyone on the phone, unless I called them first. ~~Fellow fraud specialist checking in! Textbook billing error. Claim denied. I get a special kind of justice boner sticking it to assholes like you described. Makes up for all the years of customer service bullshit I had to put up with.

My favorite line they give is this is bad customer service! Well guess what bitch? Im NOT customer service, Im a fraud specialist. My job is to protect both you and the bank from fraud losses, not kiss your ass and beg for a good survey.~~I've had a threatening call before... guy threatened to ""Find you and take a rifle to your building"". Now I am pro-2nd amendment but not to this level. I ended up having to talk to our security for a long time about it. They had his address from his account. Idk what happened after that. ~~Woah. I guess this situation varies HEAPS around the world. In Australia, people have a right to privacy. That means they are allowed to talk to any company / call centre, without being recorded, and without telling the agent who they are, if they wish. Of course, they can only ask ""general"" and ""hypothetical"" questions, not specifics about their account. But yeah - if we hang up on someone who doesn't want their call recorded, that's an instant and significant fine the business cops!

I'm also aware that some cultures - including some of our Aboriginal groups - believe that if they are on photos / videos / recordings after their death, they are unable to travel to the afterworld (or something similar. I don't claim to be an expert on this!).~~I work for an organisation that offers distance learning. When you're registering someone for a course, you've got a script that's basically ""Hey, you're registering for a course. Have you read the T's and C's?"" No one has. No one reads the T's and C's of anything. Everyone says yes. Except one guy. I tell him he needs to go to the website to read them because, well, technically he does. He asks if I can register him anyway and I have to say no because he said the one thing no-one else has ever said. Complete waste of time for everyone involved. ~~I understand where you're coming from. It really bothers me when people refuse basic politeness &amp; seemingly go out of their way to be rude, or to call negative attention to a small thing instead of just moving on. It puts me on edge as if I did something wrong when I *know* in my head I wasn't the problem.~~Yea, why ever possibly would you need information to distinguish HER account from the thousands of others your company handles... and why would you ask for security information to determine that she is someone who SHOULD have private details about her account. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I took those calls I used to give in after a few tries and call them the wrong name. Like, thier name was Karen, but I would say ""Okay great Sheila I have everything up here, now what can I help with?"" And they were always like, No, my name is Karen. ""Oh my gosh I am terribly sorry. I didnt get the right information from you so I just guessed which account it was!"" Sometimes they got the point, most times they wanted my supervisor. My supervisor thought it was hilarious.~~We get a lot of non English speakers at our centre who get their English speaking friends to call for them. They're usually there in the background because every question I ask, there's a pause, then a muffled conversation before they come back and give the answer to things like date of birth, address, rego etc. Things you would expect yourself to know. I call them out and they're often very honest and just think that they're helping their friend. It's just annoying because a) their friend just needs to authorise them either for the call, the case or on their file for the future or b) let me know you need a translator and I'll get one for you, no drama. But don't get ME in crap because privacy is just a word to you.~~","The commenter works for a utility company and frequently receives phone calls from customers who want to change their cell phone plans.

Some ppl are never happy.~~I do this all the time.  Working in insurance and some kid wants to buy a brand new car with a trash record . It's like 6000 a year but he don t seem to care.  I put him on hold and I hear him tell his buddies 
I just need to get it off the lot. I'm never going to pay for it.
I  Come back with a hard no. Need payment in full
I could still give it to him but it would create a huge headache for us, the bank and most seriously, for  him. The only one ahead is the greasy sales team that doesn't care if he can make payments or not. 
He hates me and him and the sales people were talking shit about me but.. I think I did the right thing ~~&gt;. and of course it's ALSO against company policy to call these people out on not getting back to us in a timely fashion.

If you can't correct the record, your company looks bad and you don't get the business you should have had since it was not your error. Even if management disregards your feelings (which isn't good) why are they throwing away potential profits?~~Customers call in and bitch about automated answering and menus, but once they get a real person, they tend to forget they are talking to a *real person*. 

A *real person* has the ability to snap back and put a bitch in their place when put under intense pressure or abused by a customer without support from a TL or at least a floor walker.~~I would have ended the call long before you did.  She's not only wasting her time (and who really cares), but she's wasting yours, and by extension, other customers.

If a fraudster customer calls up and asks the status of their order, the system will tell us it's fraud. We aren't allowed to let the customer know that it's fraud however, we just tell them that they're going through thorough checks. I assume so the fraud team can be informed. Takes away the fun of it when you get a fraudster customer.~~She really lost it because her item hadn't shipped after ONE business day? 

People are losing their fucking minds. Had an escalated caller bitch at me because he didn't receive a letter we sent out on the 17th until the 23rd.  As if the cu controls the mail system.

Then he called me a liar and said we never tried to call before sending the letter. He actually demanded an investigation into whether or not we called him and he wanted written correspondence at the conclusion of this investigation. He ended up failing security. I call numbers on file on account, they're all fucking out of service.

We deserve a bonus from our employers for dealing with extra unnecessary crap.~~Sounds like an entitled prick. you offered double the amount they paid in compensation and they still didn't like it?

Bis zum nchsten mal!~~Its not just Orthodox Jews, but many Jews choose to keep what is called Shomer Shabbat. Essentially this means so electronics (including turning on and off lights or even using the oven or the stove).  Sabbath (Friday night into Saturday evening) is a day of rest in the Jewish religion. This is not uncommon. However, if this person claimed they had to take off of work for this delivery, then they do not keep this tradition and should have answered the phone. And if not the phone, they should have at least answer the door. 

I will admit, Jews all practice this tradition differently, but it would be extremely unusual for someone to be okay with working on Shabbat but be against answering the phone. They also should not have expected you to automatically know their religious observations.

E.g. ""Unfortunately due to your swearing and the threats I am terminating the call and reporting you to management."" You could even involve the police with these sorts of threats.

If possible, have a step by step instruction ready for what he needs to do to solve his issue and ask your supervisor to be ready for an escalation if he behaves the same way.

Dont let it get to you and dont let it ruin your day. His rudeness is his shortcoming, not yours. Treat yourself to a nice cup of coffee or something else after work. You deserve it.~~Truck drivers are governed by regulations that limit their available hours (this is good, keeps them awake &amp; all of us alive on the roads). The downside is if they are held, this screws their whole route.

Their dispatchers should be planning their routes ahead of time with your company. 

Drivers are generally paid by the mile, so the time they are waiting is time not being compensated. 

If I wasn't being paid &amp; the hours I was allowed to work were ticking away, I'd be unhappy too.~~When I consider the markup clothing retailers put on their product, it robs me of the ability to have disdain for begging customers.

I used to look down on begging customers when I worked at Rogers. One day a customer asked me for the company cost per minute of cell use.

I was taken off guard. I hadn't ever been told or wondered what that was. So I did some research (not for the customer, he was long gone). It was staggering. The cost was so low I could realistically view the 35c per minute we charged 100% profit. 

After that, I gave every discount I could justify to me my boss, not whatever discount made sense to me. We got $50 per call in credits back in those days. 100 calls per day on average....~~If I pay $4 for a gallon of milk this week, but I paid $3.50 two weeks ago, I dont get to bitch that I expect to keep paying $3.50.
Prices change and it sucks but to wait 4-5 years to reorder and get mad about an increase?  Wake up lady!~~If I'm reading this right, you owned up to it immediately. 

Pantry Coordinator knew it still needed to be done and handled the business of getting it done. 

Coordinator fixed the glitch, but wanted you to know that you fucked up, but that they also covered for you. A good coordinator would want to keep a good employee but make sure they didn't mess up again. ~~I had a cable guy who had a window between 8am and 8 pm.. I waited all day and he never showed up and when I called it went to voicemail.

The next day I get a survey call from a robot asking how my experience was.

Two days later I get a phone call from the cable guy saying he was at my house for the service.

He did his work and said the company was crap with scheduleing.

The next week I get a customer service person call me to see what happened and why I don't give high marks on the survey.~~As someone who had a LOT of trouble getting a resolution from one of the major delivery apps. How much do they empower you for appeasement? 

We called and got hung up on by a driver 13 times when trying to direct them to our job (we work in a mall, and our building isnt labeled) then he left and said he couldnt find us.

We asked nicely several times for a supervisor and when we got transferred the rep placed a reorder without our permission, the call was answered and hung up on, and they wouldnt escalate when we called back because we already chose an accommodation~~People are so confusing. I take orders over the phone for a tourist place in TN, USA and I told a lady her total after shipping was added but our new system took out the tax because its just weird. Her new total was 40.00 and her total with tax was 43.44 and she complained to me about that  like...okay. I can happily change it and get my 3.44 if you want. ~~This makes a huge difference in someones life. I know its not the same but a company resent me a whole entertainment stand after three months of it sitting in the box while we waited to move into our new home. It made me look at the company in a whole new light and I stand by them more often when I need something odd for my home.~~Complaining must be a sport for some people, because that it's bizarre enough that she thought something being cheaper was a bad thing, but she also felt compelled to pick up her phone, dial your number and complain about it?

Did she expect you to respond with: ""I'm sorry, I'll make sure the eggs are more expensive for you next time""? Hahaha.~~&gt;after much back and forward my boss broke protocol and sent them a recording of both calls.

Gotta love how sharing a recording of a call the other party was involved in and started a dispute about is breaking protocol, because god forbid you get to defend yourself by using common sense~~I want to call it the Wal-Mart Effect, but in this case we'd be blaming Amazon.


You aren't doing something that matches the ur-example of (whatever) the customer has in their head, and rage and confusion are sure to follow.


Wal-Mart effect because I hear about it a lot in TalesFromRetail.. people get used to 'open 24/7/365, you can get cold medicine, shotgun ammunition, DVDs and milk in the same store' so it's like the world is ending when they happen to be in a store that isn't like that.


But something similar happens in TalesFromYourServer.. people expect every place to be like Dennys or Perkins.. open 24/7 with a menu wide enough that you can get breakfast at 8 pm and a burger at 3 am.~~We recently started emailing invoices for orders that are ready for dispatch before we get time to do the paperwork, so the orders are sent out faster. We get customers asking where their invoice is and we tell them it has been emailed. 

Some are fine with it, though some insist that it needs to be in the box. I tell them the truth, that we can put a note on their account that in future we will hold the order from dispatch until we get the paperwork back to prepare their invoice and then ship the box. When they hear the word ""hold"" they are suddenly they are fine with an emailed invoice.~~","The commenter had a bad experience with customer service when their baby was born, but they were able to remain calm and communicate with the representative. They also mention that their previous company had a similar policy of giving three warnings to abusive customers and giving them time off if they get worked up. The commenter"
2.0,"OMG I totally feel you right now. The amount of people I get every single day that have ""an account"" but no actual information is obscene and I hate it!!! I love being able to say 'sorry, I can't exchange that, you'll have to reorder the correct product ' and its glorious~~Wish is always late because the stuff is all from China and shipping internationally takes forever, especially right now. I ordered stuff prior to the pandemic in 2019 and I did not get it until October despite saying 6 weeks.

But I don't know what that guy wanted you to do. You did not have the item so how can you ship it.~~The supply chain issue has just caused all sorts of headaches... ""I bought this product because I was told it was a good product but you're telling me there's no parts? Ugh, what a shitty company!""

Yeah, sure dude. We magically have parts that we're just withholding because we want to be mean.~~I've been working from home for over a year (started before covid).  I love when people take issue with being at home.  Honestly its much noisier in the crowded office.  They should love how nice it is this way.  

I do escalations for credit cards and I love your escalation department.  That's so me.  I love putting fun notes on the accts hoping the transferring rep checks it later and has a good laugh.  My most recent favorite was, ""advised customer that not wanting to take advantage of other payment options isn't a bank error"" for some dick who was mad we closed the card.  Apparently it was OUR fault for not being able to do an epay because he only wanted to pay that way.~~I love how that is their go to or report us to the bbb. I work for a credit card company and you find a lot of people cand do basic addition or subtraction. You go over their bill with them all the numbers add up and they still think it's wrong. When you ask them where is it wrong they cant find an error so they threaten to sue or call the bbb. It's awesome.~~Yeah she totally said, AND I QUOTE, Well the tag says its a queen but its not a queen ...... like I dont know in what scenario a mattress producer would falsely label a full mattress a queen mattress. However, I did offer to exchange the mattress to see if it was falsely mislabeled so that she can get the correctly labeled queen mattress and she still denied.... I dont know about you, but that sounds fishy as hell to me with trying to get out of paying the usage and pickup fees ~~I once read an email at work from a customer who said everyone at my company should be hung on crosses and whipped with a cat-o'-nine-tails. Then he described our bloody demises in detail. Because he was mad that we billed him for a service he requested (using the credit card details he provided when he signed up for said service, which was rendered in full exactly as agreed in his contract). ~~I've had a few circumstances where a customer claimed our stores were racist, so I've dealt with the opposite problem before.

Though they usually sound about the same and after speaking with stores more than a few times I'm not always 100% certain if they're telling the truth.

Like this one person said that they were threatened by the store rep and stalked out to their car, which I don't believe, but I suppose it's possible?

A lot of people try to scam us anyway so I wouldn't put it past them to fake a racism issue.~~I currently work customer service for a gift basket company. A lot of our customers are businesses who order gifts from us to their customers if they've complained.

One such recipient called me and was shouting off the bat saying 2 boxes from US arrived at her house, she doesn't know who we are and how have we charged her card for these things to her house with her and her husband's name and address when she doesn't know us. We're clearly a fraud etc etc.

I tried to calm her down, took her details and found her order. Explained that X company had ordered gift baskets for her and her husband for complaints and informed her that if she actually looked at these things, she'd see the message from the company telling them what it was for.

I still have no idea why or how she thought we'd charged her or what she was looking at on her statement but that was a difficult one.

Morons.~~Lets do some math.  100 cups.  Pretend super high end coffee at $5 a cup.  Thus $500.  Maybe a $1 profit per pastry.  So at worst a $400 loss.  They had a lot of other problems.  I would almost think the cost of a third party to run that marketing would cost more than $400~~""But I'm disabled!"" is my least favorite excuse for anything that doesn't involve exertion or a venture out into the outside world. Conversely, I also speak to a lot of disabled people who tell me things like ""Oh, well, I'm disabled, but if you tell me what I need to do, I'll call my son and we'll do it when he can come over!""

Look, it sucks to be disabled. I'm temporarily disabled myself and I get it: everything's about 10,000 times harder. But I mean...you offered *home pick-up*. Somebody could *come to her damn house and get it for her.* It doesn't get much lower effort than that.~~I had a customer that called all pissed cause she got the wrong thing in the mail(online is a totally separate store)
She wanted me to ship out the right one for free(no charge for the item) and she would be sure to return the first item when she got a chance-



Seriously ?~~On the other side of the same coin.
I subscribed to a partwork, a series of graphic novels. I'm in Ireland, the company was a UK based firm, and they outsourced to a French company.
I got the first delivery.
I got the second one, twice.
No hassle with the following four deliveries, then they stopped.

I emailed them, they responded that the delivery had been refused as undeliverable. I queried, they responded that the British Post Office couldn't find my address - the company had somehow managed to change my address to one in a town in Wales. Not just the country name, the town too.
I asked them to resend them to my actual address, so they did. Four times. They then charged me four times.
It took me three more months of emails to get them to cancel my subscription!~~When I was in the center, I just resorted to a flat, bored, monotone, making them think I was reading something off a script if they kept badgering me about something. I'd repeat it over and over again in the same tone as Ben Stein in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.~~I've used this same tactic with the people that come into my restaurant (which is take-out only right now due to COVID) and ask me-- despite the lack of other customers, stacked tables and chairs, a huge sign saying TAKE-OUT ONLY, and a fucking regionally mandated closure that's been on effect for the last two weeks-- if they can have a table for two. 

C: table for two?

Me: Sorry, takeout only.

C: so we can't sit inside?

Me: Sorry, takeout only.

C: well can we sit outside? (Note: there are no tables outside)

Me: Sorry, takeout only

C: So we can't have a table?

Me: Sorry, takeout only.

C: Can we order to-go?

Me: ~~In Pa. Theres a Fed Ex facility that does the same thing. Said my DVD player was lost, two weeks after they said my I Pad was too. Told them I was going to send the police there to look for stolen merchandise, and what do you know, showed up next day.~~I have always been of the ""you go ahead and be mad, sir, and I still wont care"" camp.

What's the worst that happens? Some moron from a legal office with a n overinflated sense of self-worth yells at you for a bit? Hes an idiot and we all know it.  Your boss ain't going to fire you for it, and you know you're right, so just put the phone down and let him vent his stupid spleen into the ether. 

When you reach the true pinnacle of call center zen, nothing a customer says can ever hurt you again.  :)~~Customer called, his internet was out because lightning hit the pole and it was on fire. Dude called his ISP BEFORE calling the fire department. Th pole was burning the whole time he was on hold to talk to us. We called the fire department for him when he hung up.~~Im a CC fraud investigator and I love when I get an identity thief. I let them go through the long identification process and then say Look. I think we both know youre not Mr/Mrs SoandSo. Weve traced your call and information has been sent to local authorities. Soooooo satisfying hahahahaha~~Her frustration is understandable. Not at all your fault and it shouldn't be taken out on you, but the company should have a master list of addresses that have called enough to make it clear they don't want your junk mail, so when their info is bought next time, they stay off the list. It'll save the company money too, since they won't waste printings and postage on a definite no-sale.~~I had a customer on our chat line, this past week, ask for the phone number so she could speak with a manager regarding our convo regarding price matching our retail partners. She was upset that we were content to lose a customer. No, were not losing a customer, dumbass; youre still buying the companys product, just from a retailer instead of from the manufacturer. I told her she was certainly welcome to save more money by purchasing at a lower price and free shipping. So fucking petty. I went back and reviewed the chat transcript and I was nothing but pleasant. ~~I don't know if this would help at all, but a redditor once recommended a book to me called ""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss. It's a book about how to negotiate with people properly (Voss was a top FBI negotiator), and one of the things I remember most from the book is how to get people to respond to emails ASAP. Just one line: ""Have you given up on \[insert name of project\]?"" Most of the time, if not always, that will freak people out into responding sooner. I usually now get a response in under 24 hours.~~Thats why I correct peoples attitude immediately when they start shit like that. 

Sir, I am more than happy to help you with whatever problem you may have, but you will have to communicate with me like a person, cause that is what I am. I can do all kinds of things to help you, and if you treat me with the respect I deserve, I will do those things. The other option is that i hang up.

Sorts them out reallly quickly.~~","The commenter expresses frustration with customers who don't provide any information about their orders, especially when it comes to the supply chain issue.

2.0,"I hate members/customer that feel that just because they've been member/customer for x number of years that they're entitled to a discount or that we should let them slide on whatever it is they're trying to get away with. 

This is way I'm always nice when I call some place because I know that when a member is rude to me, even if there's a way for me to help them, I won't do it because I'm not about to go out of my way to help someone who wants to scream and throw a fit to get their way.~~Honestly you are pretty spot on. It all comes down to a total lack of understanding of chemistry, biology, or really any science. 

These are the same people that complain chicken nuggets (or their boogeyman food of choice) are one ingredient away from plastic (they never are). I usually point out to those kinds of people either that water is one atom away from poison or that both sodium and chlorine will kill us but put them together and we will die if we dont get them. I can judge immediately if the person is redeemable by whether or not they ask me to explain vs just shut up and tune me out.~~I used to do this with pervy callers when I worked night shift. I was the supervisor and, at the time, all my agents where female. I didn't like the fact that some perv with nothing better to do would call in and harass them so screwing with them was also a way to look after my staff. Had to stop once management got wise bit it fun while it lasted. My manager thought it was funny but told me to stop because the clients probably wouldn't appreciate it.~~Playing Devil's Advocate for a moment...      Our mail carrier regularly marks things as 'delivery attempted' when no such attempt was made.    I'd watched the USPS truck drop of letters at the mailbox, then drive on.  The status of the package switches from ""out for delivery"" to ""delivery attempted"" and calls to the post office are met with; ""The carrier must have attempted otherwise the status wouldn't say that.  We don't redeliver so it'll be available for pickup at the post office 10 miles away.""

I understand the anger, but it is misdirected towards you.~~I use to work in a credit union call center and I LOVED catching fraudsters. 

My favorite was this dude with a thick accent with a very white name (something like john smith) and claimed he was a GENERAL.  I looked up this general, whitest man ever. I looked up both addresses he gave us (work/ home). His home was in Virginia, U.S (cuz, military) and his work address was in las vegas. I looked up the las vegas address and it was this janky looking house.~~The caller was an asshat and you should follow whatever your process is to report threats of violence, BUT I would not do it this time, because if they pull that call and hear you tell him to f off, odds are you are going to get in trouble and at some centers, you could get fired.  Let it go this time and next time, follow your process and think it in in your head if you want but don't say it out loud.~~When people yell and scream I will typical go completely silent. They will rant for a little and eventually theyll get real pissed and scream ARE YOU STILL THERE!! 
Then I calmly say sorry I was waiting for you to finish
It either makes them realize how foolish theyve been or it sets them off even further. Either way its a win win ~~I wish the call center for the delivery service I work for had the guts you do. As often as we call out fraudulent customers from our store, the call center keeps reimbursing them with extravagant vouchers. Sometimes they aren't even customers; they just call to complain about our drivers!~~Thimerosal contains ethyl mercury; *methyl* mercury is harmful kind that bioaccumulates in fish. It's understandable that some people are afraid of the former, but you can dispel the fear with knowledge of very simple chemistry. The difference between the two is akin to the difference between ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol: One gets you drunk, the other will make you go blind.~~My shit list is a post it note on the side of my computer.  I only deal with about 55 stores, but can never remember which Steve works where.  Every store has a Steve, Michael or an Alan, I swear.  And theyve all rotated on and off my shit list.  Current top of the list?  Assistant store manager who only answers the phone Hello instead of the usual thanks for calling ___store, my names ___, how can I help you? (Or whatever variation thereof)  The store phones dont have caller ID, so I know this is how he answers when customers call.  Also hes one of those terrible employees who everyone knows sucks but somehow still has a job.  Anyways.~~A friend of mine ordered a bunch of gym equipment since our gym is closed, and shes a gigantic bitch and ALWAYS embarrasses everyone shes with because of how she treats service staff of any kind, so I keep assuming this phone call was her and I gotta say Im sorry.~~Wow. When I started playing with patinas I made sure to read the instructions very carefully. Because, you know, chemicals. Just like when I learned electroplating I listened closely to the guy training me and made sure not to breathe what they told me not to breathe. While I kind of see where his mistake came from I don't think he looked at the directions at all.~~These types of calls are the bane of my existence!! I am forever telling people that yes, the service technician is still coming.  He will call when he is on his way to make sure you are home. So, if you need to pop down to the corner store to grab something,  by all means do so. 

I will never understand why some folks insist on taking the day off from work and waiting around all morning when they have an appointment late in the afternoon.  Then when its an hour before the end of their arrival window, they start freaking out. It makes zero sense to me~~I'm sorry that you had to offer him anything.  What do you want to bet that he is one of those that knows the system and does this on a constant basis.  Besides, if you go into the store and they are out of stock of something, then you either find a substitution or you do without.   I would love to be compensated every time my 7/11 is out of Slurpees.............but I digress.

Sorry that you had to deal with this rotten apple.~~What an asshole. At first I thought his package wasn't delivered and understood that he may be a little frustrated, though that should be with the delivery service, not the sender. Then I realized he was mad because he had to go to his mailroom to get the mail he received and was mad at the company he bought the goods from. Just... What...?~~As a consumer,  I have never understood this. I ordered a litter robot for my cat. It blatantly said on the site and on the order confirmation page that it typically takes 2 weeks to build it and then time for it to be delivered. Plus, Global Pandemic. But let me tell you, that wait was worth it. It seems some people have no patience these days. Sorry you had to deal with that level of entitlement.~~I used to work postal in the military on a NAVY ship. When I would quote shipping times, people (usually higher ups) would ask if there was a way to send it express because there's usually three day shipping.

No thought at all to the fact we were sitting in the middle of the pacific ocean...

Yes, sir, I'll gladly just jump off this ship, and swim to California for you, run it through customs then send it off to your wife FOUR POSTAL ZONES AWAY in Alabama.~~WELL THAN SHOP WITH THAT FUCKING COMPANY!!!! 
I work at a bank and I hear the other bank I go to would do this. Does this look like the other bank?  Do you honestly expect every company in one industry to do everything exactly the same? Fuck off....
I dont actually say that but I want to so bad~~When I was in the Navy, I heard a story about an officer who accidentally spilled a bag of candy in the cockpit of a jet. The maintenance crew had to go out and buy ten bags, count the number of candies, and average the number, and then find that many in the cockpit for the aircraft to be ""FOD free"".~~Christ almighty I hate those cxs!

I wish we could tell them: ""Hey, you called us for help, I let you know the procedure/process and YOU want to tell me how to do it? Sure, why don't you apply here  and show me how it's done? Hell, why don't you teach the management while you're at it?!""~~I don't really understand the demand for price matching. I mean, I can understand why retailers do it, just not why people ask for the service.

If I can buy it cheaper down the road, I'm going to do business with the shop down the road. The only reason I might ask for a price match is if the shop down the road runs out of stock.~~Pro tip for people who call on phones that have necessary information: if you hit your home button or exit the Phone app, you're able to navigate to other apps for information while your call is still active.

I used to have people put me on speaker, navigate out of the phone app, and log into their Amazon app (and I was the first one to tell them how to do it) all the time.~~It always amazed me, the number of customers who would request something bizarre, be told *that we don't have a physical mechanism to even do what they wanted to do*, but would still persist in trying to talk you into doing it.  

Don't you have anything better to do than waste a bunch of time trying to coax me into doing a literally impossible thing?~~We used to give out WOW awards to these types of people. Wanker Of the Week. It took some doing to earn one and it was usually the same people over and over usually for telling us how to do our jobs despite us being the most experienced and having final say in the process.~~Asking for warehouse peices makes me think its a wholeseller that begins with a c. 

In which case tou very much have my sympathy. Number of times i had people try and say they would send trading standards to fine me peraonally because the online price was higher then the warehouse price. Refused to see that the delivery was included in the price and if they needed a return or replacement there would be no shipping costs for them.

Soany times got told the price difference was too much for it to just be delivery.

In our office the supervisors didnt have our backs and often rolled over and got a discount for the people.~~","The commenter dislikes members and customers who complain about receiving discounts or other benefits because they lack understanding of chemistry, biology, or any science.

2.0,"I feel this on my bones! I work in electronics.

It seems like prices have risen weekly, or even  daily on some of our parts. 

Especially since covid hit, and now there's a microchip shortage....

I don't control the pricing. 

And prices change normally anyways. Add in a volatile market, a global pandemic, and a massive parts shortage....

But if you call and expect the same prices for something you haven't ordered since 2018? Ha.

(BTW, not ordering since 2018 is like 5 years in electronics years or something. It's like dog years. Its forever.)

And, don't even get me started on how irrationally upset they get on tariff charges. 


I don't control those either.~~Funny story but that dad handled that situation terribly. If he was really worried about his son getting in trouble he shouldn't have reported the incident to anyone.

If it was weed and he opened the package before the driver, what would you have been doing next? Calling the police?~~Wait, a minute, what?

Assuming that AC's company specifically requested this coupon and was 100% okay with it....how exactly is any of this your fault? THEY requested the coupon. You guys just put pictures on a document and formatted it how they wanted.

Also....don't most places do coupons like this the opposite way? If your company is a coffee company, why not make it a free **pastry** with every coffee? Because if giving away 100 free cups of coffee was enough to completely ruin them, why would they risk that much of a loss? I'm not great with business, but bread sounds like it would be much cheaper.

I'm sorry but I can't let you have your car.
Why not? 
Because you can't read.
What are you talking about? 
If you could read you would know that your car was impounded in another city. The ticket you just handed me clearly states your car was towed by another company to their yard. So I can't let you have your car. ~~I had a guy once arguing with me essentially that his rate should've increased after he made some changes to his policy (it did go up, but apparently not as much as he thought it would go), and I literally had to stop and ask him ""Are you... are you saying that you want to be paying more each month?"" and that kind of stopped him in his tracks.  ~~People are dumb. Had one the other day escalate because he had transposed his BA and SA. Our site asks for BA to be entered first and this d-bag put his SA instead. So his shits being sent to his BA. He gets the order confirmation and calls to piss and moan about HIS mistake and blame it on US. 

Orders processed, cant change it now, so sorry, blah blah blah. He starts going off about how we cant process it b/c the BA is incorrect and the CC company wouldnt approve the order b/c OUR system switched the addresses. Yeah, no, Mr. D-Bag, that doesnt happen; YOU entered the addresses incorrectly and YOU obviously have no idea what our payment security systems do and dont look for as far as red-flagging an order. YOU are the a-hole, but please hold while I transfer you to a Supe.~~The amount of times this happens is honestly unbelievable. Then they get angry at us for not calling them to find out where they moved to.

Like buddy, we're an inbound call centre. With thousands of customers. It's not our job to chase you. It's your responsibility to make sure your sensitive post isn't getting posted elsewhere.~~That's weird that you can't exclude from future lists at your company. I used to work at a place that would put the name and address in the database as a ""do not mail"" and then all future rented lists, we'd run them through a routine to take off anyone in the do not mail from the latest list before forwarding the filtered list to mailing. I just assumed everyone would do that.~~They just love to complain. Our shipping is 3-5 business days. Complain. Shipping cost $5.95. Complain. Expedite shipping has been gone since last year, cause they can't have too many people in the warehouses. People still want to complain about that.

I wasn't allowed to hang up calls when I worked in tech support, so setimes you sat there for 10 minutes listening to them yell. You get used to it, though. Throw them on mute and lean back in your chair, maybe play some solitaire or read a book. It's not so bad. ~~I am curious to why you didnt tell him right away that you wouldnt deliver the 2nd package? Why say you would then make him call back? I get that he was a complete ass but isnt better to remain professional and not sink to his level with petty games? 

You were absolutely right to ban him but I think purposely escalating the situation and blatantly lying is kind of mean :( ~~To be fair, I had a delivery set for a bike on a Saturday late morning and stayed in. Guy never showed. I called the office to see what happened and they were closed until Monday.

I called back Monday and there was no apology, just he couldnt make it. Great, I lost a Saturday thinking maybe he was running late for nothing.

The reset the delivery for a Thursday morning and guess what? Didnt show during the scheduled times. So I called their office and got oh yeah, hes still going today but will be in the evening. Delays, etc 

It might be annoying for you to get these calls,  it its even more annoying for people who plan their days around deliveries and never get real time updates. 

This is why I love UPS btw. I always get texts with ETAs and updates~~I worked for a tech support call center as a tier 1 tech. Got a call and the lady said that she was just talking to a tech and the call was dropped. She wanted that tech, I asked if she knew his name. 
She said no but ""he sounded black"" WTF?
How does someone sound black? 
I got her info and found the last tech and transfered her to him. 
BTW he is whiter then I am.~~Hey that all the time for returns. ""I dropped it off at the carrier! Once I've done that its out of my hands! I can't be held responsible if they lose it!""

Yet if YOUR stuff doesn't show up from us you call us and not the carrier. Funny how that works. 

I'm sure companies have insurance and stuff that covers that sort of thing that a consumer wouldn't, but the line of logic makes me laugh anyway.~~How bout she stop just typing her address in to every place that asks and she'd stop getting spam. My friend sends their spam back, via the post office. And he receives no spam after he did that for about a year. The companies stopped mailing him anything extra. Worked like a charm. I've never tried it, I'm too lazy to drive all the way to the post office. I just recycle mine.~~I totally called the customer complaint line when I was like 8 months pregnant because I made  cinnamon rolls and they stuck to the pan and the package told me not to grease the pan  after I wasnt pregnant and all my crazy hormones were gone I felt so incredibly stupid.~~This is just one example of Economics 101.  

Look stupid, it works like this:  there's this thing called a price.  If you want the widget that's what it costs.  Don't want to pay that much?  Then you don't get the widget.   And why are you always in front of me in the checkout line?  Please go home.

Yes, Amazon does an amazing job with shipping, and has changed (and destroyed) retail sales for many products.  But don't believe for a second that shipping is ""free"".  The charge is baked into the Prime fee that is buried in your maxed out Amazon credit card.~~God this reminds me of a woman yesterday who brought her drink back to the coffee shop I work at and asked for her iced teas to be remade because there wasnt any ice in them... Which would be fine, except the sticker on the drink said she bought them 4 hours ago, they were half empty, and they were literally warm. Because she had been drinking them. For 4 hours.~~In satellite TV, a client called from an airport to temporarily stop his service, he was flying to Germany for a funeral. This was 1999 so he was on a pay phone.
Then he politely asked if I could look up our top competitors phone number for him. He said he only subscribed to them for their German language channel and he was running out of coins for the pay phone. 
So yes, I looked up the number so he could call them to suspend his service too. He was super nice.~~I have a small arsenal of meaningless phrases that can be taken to mean anything so as to not somehow offend whenever someone gets like that, stuff like ""oh it's one of those things isn't it"", ""well, you're not the first and you certainly won't be the last"", ""well, technology is notoriously fickle isn't it"" etc etc~~I dislike it when people do this. One good thing at my previous work place, as a customer service agent, was that we were allowed to disconnect calls.

I remember one call, where I had re-iterated the same meaning of something (can't remember what - this was some years ago) for about three times - differently. Finally I said;

- Look, I have told you this already. This is due that and that. I will now disconnect the call as I can't see this discussion leading anywhere

2.0,"When 50"" TVs were selling for $1500 I found a site that had an exceptional Sony model for just $300

I was ready to order one but then thought my Grandpa who had needed a new TV for some time might in on this too so I called him and he says he needed to talk to Grandma about it first and would call back

What he did instead was call the company to ask for details about that specific model...of course once they heard the price the site claimed they immediately removed that model from the web site til they could adjust the price(the new price was around $2000)

Arggh!  They would of honored the first price if I hadn't gotten greedy by thinking about getting two of them and not ordering before they caught their error!~~Invasion of privacy? On a public page? That's like not looking at someone walking down a public street in the middle of the afternoon. Do you wear a blindfold every time you walk out your front door? Same thing. The customer needs to make something private before his privacy can be violated.

I would be so tempted to make a throwaway page and make public posts empathizing with him for his ""loss"" and expressing my happiness that they were able to have more children after the one was stillborn two years ago. 

If only you could have sent a response email stating how all of you at company X sympathized with him and his wife for their loss, and would therefore be willing to override policy and give him store credit- and include the wife in the email in case she is unaware that her husband is a $&amp;@"".~~I guess the company is not European, as that is a clear violation of GDPR. 

You dont have her consent, you are not allowed to email her. 

In every case your company spams, not sure you want to call out a woman(, who has probably been told by another spam company that they have an algorithm for it and it takes some time to process it.) when you are doing a generally considered bad practice yourself~~I had someone ask me for a control number. My work as far as I know does not have control numbers. I thought maybe they were after a payment number so gave it to them and then they told me that was wrong and they wanted a control number. When I asked to elaborate what they meant they hung up the phone.

I have still have no idea what they meant by control number. If anyone can help that would be great lol.~~I'm used to bulk buying in general. With crippling depression, PTSD, and a crazy work schedule, I usually can't make it out to a supermarket to get what I need every week. So, I buy them in bulk on Amazon or Instacart. It'd last me a month. 

When the quantity limit was put in place, I'll admit. I panicked for a few days and started rationing my food. But then I realized that, I'm working from home. My mom was laid off. She can go buy stuff now if we need it. No need to panic. 

I still struggle with not being able to buy in bulk but I think it's good to have that limit in place. After all, before COVID, very few people bought in bulk for themselves. Now, everyone is doing it and it's not ok.~~I work for a very large company.  My favorite calls are the ones where they say, I need you to pull up John Smiths account with no further information.  Can you give me an address? A STATE? Anything else associated with this account other than the most common name in the world, while we have literally 20 million accounts?~~I've been working from home for two years now. My sister works nights so she sleeps during the day. My nieces are pretty quiet when they're home but school just started. There are two doors to get to my office, both of which remain closed when I'm working. About two days ago a woman called in. The first thing she did was start complaining about all of the noise and how rude I was being. The only noise in my house was the AC and the music playing through my headphones that was barely audible to me. Some people just love to find dumb reasons to complain.~~That ""you did"" is absolutely golden.

I now want to know what pizza delivery call centers are like for my own curiosity. Ideally, every team meeting comes with pizzas to spotlight featured items. You would in turn be judged if you were to bring leftovers from a rival pizzeria or restaurant. 

Realistically, I'm guessing that at best, they maybe got pizzas for major events like holidays.~~","The commenter found an exceptional Sony TV for just $300 on an online store, but when they called the company to ask for details, they were told that the model was removed from the web site until they could adjust the price.

3.0,"i got a call once from a guy asking me if his phone bill could be left at the corner for him to pick up. or if he could meet the mail man somewhere to get it.

When i asked him why he needed this done he said he didn't want his wife to see the phone bill. (was looking at his phone records while we were talking and its clear he had a GF on the side) 

i told him for legal reasons it had to be safely delivered to the address on the account unless he was willing to pay for a PO box registered to the post office in his area.  he got mad at me and hung up.

i was like dude you are a pig and im not helping you cheat on your wife!~~I cant tell you how many times a dr or their staff has told me they called/got approval and they never really did. Just assumed stuff would be covered. Nothing like getting a surprise bill for over $3k bc someone is just lazy af. Once got a bill for almost $8k for an ambulance transfer and 1 night in a different hospital bc the dr ""just figured it would be fine"" - his words! I've even been turned away for big tests like an MRI bc dr's staff said they got it preapproved but didnt.~~(on mobile) This reminds me of a conversation I had with a customer (working in tech support for a mobile company) : Customer *comes with a defective Sim card, 4 years old, no phone was detecting it at all, we did several tests and came to the conclusion the Sim card needed to be changed*.

Me : so it seems the Sim card needs to be changed. The phone is working fine (tested a different sim card and it worked). 

Customer : so I have to change my phone. 

Me : that won't be necessary, just the Sim card. 

Customer : will a newer phone model read the Sim?

Me : no, not this one, it's dead. 

Customer : I guess I'll have to go to *another phone maker/company *

Me : *completely giving up all hope for humanity* OK.~~People misunderstand the term the customer is always right. It refers to supply and demand , like if you have red hats and blue hats but people only buy the blue hats, you get more blue hats. The saying was never intended to mean if a person is making unreasonable demands give it to them because they are sooooo valuable.~~One of the unexpected hardest parts of my job: finding out the caller's name!

What is your name? Why is this question such a stumper?!?! And yet they will provide every detail of their life starting with their birth during a snowstorm in 1954...but their name! How stupid am I to ask?! They've only changed their name five times, don't I know it by sound? Arg. 

You are patient. Bless!~~Also that's going to fuck his premiums up big time when he goes to get insured. He'll have to say that he's had a motoring offence in the last 5 years, which for driving without insurance is going to really cost him. Glad she's screwing him over in the long run too. Get fucked cheating bastard (ex)husband~~With his total refusal to call anything an accident, I'm sort of wondering if he might have had more fault in this than he admits. I mean, with him constantly repeating he 'was in the Waffle House' it makes me wonder why he's so insistent on distancing himself from the scene of the accident.~~Call centres are always doing things like that. One time they decided to bring in giant ""5"" helium balloons for any agent who got a perfect 5 score on a call. They were annoying to have on the desk and no one wanted them. We asked if they could spend the money on a gift card for the local coffee/lunch spot. Nope.~~Lol. She cant possibly work in auto insurance and not know that, or at the very least, understand that. I have to explain this concept to people all the time and they just dont get it. Its not that hard. Insurance premiums are based on loss costs. To get the most accurate data they collect data from different components of the makeup of the risk (age, location, breed, experience, house type, whatever). This helps to create premium unique to you. Otherwise you are just lumping everyone together and everyone pays the same premium regardless of experience, tickets, etc (i.e. less riskier people subsidize the riskier people). I feel your pain OP. ~~I work for a different variety of insurance and deal with this all the time. 
""But I set up the policy""
Too bad, not the policy owner, no info for you. 
""But I pay for it""
Too bad. 
""But I'm their parent""
Nope. 
""But I'm the insured""
I. Don't. Care.~~My hubby got a call similar to this the day that iCloud launched. He got a call from a guy that wanted pics to be deleted from the cloud but couldnt because the server was down. Apparently he decides to cheat and take pics of the mistress without realizing it was then uploaded to the cloud iTunes account he shared with his WIFE. He got pissed that my hubby couldnt do anything about it. He angrily asked the hubby what he should do and my smartass love says Dont cheat?. The guy hung up after that but I hope his wife did see those pics and kicked his ass to the curb.~~If it's like the place in work for - the other agent was just lax in their duty, even if they are corporate (I work 3rd party), and higher on the pecking order. 

But, I loved stuff like that. 

For instance, when I was still on the phones (I now do my work over chat), had a guy with a pretty crappy driving history, with something that was falling off soon, but a car had been on far too long, so he wanted it taken off.  They had also recently gotten a new car.  So I went to take that car off, and guess what? All the rating went to the new car instead of the other, and hot damn did it increase.  It was my understanding they still had the old car, so it stayed on, but he went from smug to ""holy.....""~~Lol, the policy could easily apply to her if she's Canadian. I wish you could have said, ""omg, I didn't realize you were Canadian! I'm so sorry, we have a completely separate line for Canadians. I really do apologize let me get you connected.""

Then you blind transfer her to a random Quebec carrier that only speaks French~~I really hate people who won't listen. Had this one lady who was watching some game show while on the phone to update her payment method and thus avoid the cancelation of her policy. ( You'd think it's worthy of a few minutes of undiveded attention) i could barelly hear what she was saying over the sound of the tv and she was so distracted that when she did answer my questions she was completely off. At one point, after about 10mins, i basically asked her to either turn off the tv for a few minutes while she was on the phone with me or call back when her insurance situation was more important then whatever drivel she was watching.~~I used to do a happy dance every time some asshat pulled that card out of the deck. 

Per the policy, we'd have to give them the legal dept contact, special flag their account, and end the call. It was all I could due not to cackle with glee every time. 

We weren't supposed to leave the accounts open on the screen after calls, but it was always fun to watch them repeatedly call back only to be shut down every time.  ~~One of my pet peeves is the way people sling around the word ""discrimination"".  Usually by people who want their way and just aren't getting it!  


Not everything is ""discrimination"" and not every class is a federally protected class!    


I loved your response, if I could give two upvotes, I would.~~We might work for the same people.

The way the credit was explained by our company was at first very vague. Then it was updated and no everyone thinks we lied to them about how it works. 

Or they are super confused on how it works and it doesn't matter how well we explain it.~~That's great to not have to worry about retention if they threatened to cancel. When I did customer service in a call center so many people would threaten to cancel even if they really didn't want to because they knew we would have to start kissing their ass as soon as they said those magic words "" I want to cancel my service""~~Your manager is a dumbass who exemplifies the concept of The Peter Principle.

Does she understand the reason behind those hold days? Because there is literally nothing that prevents that customer from stopping the payment from coming out of her checking account even after your dumbshit boss has refunded that money. Furthermore, we don't know if that payment will even clear even if your customer is honest and/or not a complete fucking moron. That's only going to make that customer escalate when a bill for double the amount gets invoiced. Hope that Ms. Dumbshit Boss gets a sufficient dressing down from someone for that fuckup.

Edit to ask: Did she even verify that there was an error made by the company or did she just do the refund for shits and giggles?~~I'm in the claims special investigation unit, so I get all the liars. One had the gall to call me after speaking with you folks and ask why her rates were so high. Uh, because you plowed your Audi into a stucco wall at 70 mph causing $18,500 in damages to your car alone and then lied and said it was parked and then accused us of lying after we pulled the black box. Please find another insurance company.~~*""Are you having a bad day?* Well, thanks for asking. But no, I wasnt having a bad day until I received your call and realized that you were being difficult and trying to get something you werent entitled to. But enough about me, how are you doing today?   
  
Ive dealt with a few like her before and at first, they used to rattle me, but now I just make it clear that this isnt Burger King, they cannot have it their way!~~My favourite was with glass specific coverage, mostly because many states/companies do offer glass waivers. I had more than one conversation that went something like

&gt;No you do not have a glass damage waiver on your policy. You think Im wrong? Well, heres the call where you set up your policy with a licensed agent, heres the time stamp of when the agent offered the glass waiver to you, and heres the time stamp of you declining it.~~This reminds of a situation I dealt with, I work for a telecommunications company who also provides tv and internet service, their tv remote ran out of batteries and wanted a 500 dollar credit on their bill, argued with me for an hour about how stupid and incompetent our company and staff were.~~","The commenter received a call from someone asking if their phone bill could be left at the corner for them to pick up or if they could meet the mailman somewhere to get it.

3.0,"I once did inbound customer service calls for a phone company. I had a guy call in with enough credits to keep his bill paid for the next three months (dont know who applied them or why), on top of having his last two bills waived through courtesy credits. It was the most excessive abuse of courtesy credits I had ever seen, and the guy wanted more. His reasoning was, and I quote, I am a valued customer and you need to give me those credits to keep my business.

At some point, those who work customer service need to have the power to call out problem customers and tell them to their faces that they are a liability costing the company you work for money.~~At the call center I worked at they put on the floor by where the supervisors were located about ten 'prizes'(big ones too...big screen TVs and video games consoles with piles of new games included(each prize around $1000) and other electronics)

Each perfect survey was an entry into the drawing...they sat there for a month then one day they were gone

We were not told how many entries anyone had nor did anyone I know win and no one I asked(even low level supes) had heard of anyone who had won a single one of those prizes~~All i have to do is ask 3 times if someone is there with a brief pause.  If no one answers we have to ask them to call back as we can't here them and hang up. 10 minutes is too long to wait for the 'client' on the phone while they mess around. I don't know about that call centre but at mine they track our stats and I would definitely get talked to for waiting that long. ~~I hate these calls. I once had a customer berate his children and spouse for all being so stupid. He didnt like me either, even though I was giving him what he asked for. At one point he gets mad at the cat and the cat scratches the living hell out of him. Ive never liked a cat so much in my life.~~Because they think there is no consequences. 

Not sure about your company but mine has a process where we can flag abusive customers. Back  office then listens to the call to make a transcript, and calls the customer giving them their one and only formal warning, also confirms their address to post a copy of the transcript and the warning. 

If they then do the same again with any agent at any time, they are removed from the company and blacklisted, meaning they cannot come back to us for as long as they live at their current address (moving means no duplicate match unfortunately)


It also makes it difficult for family members at the same address to join us as we cannot then guarantee they aren't taking it out for that individual...~~The other day, an associate told me the BEST answer to this threat. 
Wonderful! If you could please have your lawyer send in a letter of rep, we would really appreciate that! Heres our fax # and email address!
I also work for a large insurance company in claims, and I cannot count how often this threat is thrown at me. What are you going to sue us for, enforcing the contract that YOU agreed too??!! ~~BOYYYY working in insurance offices, this happened all the time. Customers coming in wanting us to call the other insurance company. We would explain they need the customers statement, therefore the customer needed to call. Well cant you put it on speaker phone and call them so we can both talk to them?

It isnt heart surgery. You call. Tell them your info. What happened. Done. ~~We have calls like that at Expensive phone company. 

Ive been a customer for 157 years. When I started with you people we could still go to the zoo to see wholly mammoths! How dare you turn off my phone?! I havent paid since June because of covid and before that I had other bills. Turn my phone back on before I report you to the BBB! 

I exaggerated but still not far off from the norm~~This.

Whenever I'm calling any type of call centre, this is exactly the person I try to be. It makes life easier for everyone involved. 

I don't understand how so many of the public just cannot grasp the basic service interaction process - if you've ever called a call centre, it's virtually the same basic structure to facilitate the conversation yet it seems to escape common sense.

They'll call in all guns blazing and expect to get exactly where doing that?
Being pleasant and cooperative will achieve so much more than being an enormous thunder cunt.

Eh, maybe I'm jaded from too many years on the front lines of it.
Regardless, congrats on the dope call ~~I work in insurance too. I don't get commission. Daily, I have customers who argue with me on how they will leave and go somewhere else because I am not working hard enough for my commission. I explain to them I am hourly and yet they still argue with me about how I should try harder for my commission. It's like watching a cat chase it's tail!~~It's amazing how many people will sign a contract and then try to argue that because they didn't read or understand what they signed that somehow makes the contract invalid.

Sure, I don't read all the fine print either, but if I ask for something and get told its in the fine print, I know that's my fault.~~Looking at someone's account you know is a big no no in my credit union.  I know of 2 people who were fired because their boyfriend or girlfriend called and complained that they were going into their account.  I looked and sure enough they were in the account.  One person I had screen shots to show they were in the account while on a call with another customer.~~i remember when my credit card info was stolen by an employee at the great rainforest company. i called them up and the convo went

Thank you for calling spamazon this is (blah) how can i help you today! (he was so chipper, so innocent .

Me- (with barely controlled rage) honey get me your supervisor because you dont get paid enough to handle what im about to unleash.

him- uh.. can i give them a heads up about your call?

me - sure. you can let them know that someone used my info to sign up for spamazon prime illegally.

him - ohhh shit.  

at that point we didnt know it was an actual employee that stole my info, he sent me to his lead who sent me to fraud who passed me to the head of fraud after digging found out who it was. I think the head of the fraud dept was even more pissed than i was LMAO.~~Heh, reminds me. Back when I worked for a roadside assistance callcenter, we actually had an option for that. You're broken down _right now_ and need help? Sure, no problem, you get the full-cover, all-included pack with no discount and an extra (relatively small) to make it valid immediately (instead of after 48 hours), and we can help you! 

Want to just pay for this single tow, also an option! Just mind, this might even be a more expensive option depending on where you want it towed.~~I've had a couple customers I've had to tell them they were talking themselves out of a refund. Back when I was a first level escalation agent customer gets bumped to me from the front line not eligible for a refund by the system but long time customer not a lot of refund history and I'm explaining to the agent I'm going to refund him and agent doesn't want to because guys an arse. I explained we have to understand that people and money can cause excitement. 

So I get the customer and before I can do my greeting guy is just giving me hell, expletive this and that, my mother is a you know what. I'm letting him vent till he takes a breath but he never stops finally I interrupt and say you know your talking yourself out of a refund.~~Insurance agent here! I think the problem isn't really that people don't know their deductible, it's that people mistakenly assume the deductible doesn't apply to anything glass related. 

This is not helped by the fact there there is at least one state where, by law, the deductible does not apply to glass-only claims. And then there are other states and companies where you can purchase coverage to make glass a $0 deductible. It gets confusing really quickly because available coverage can vary from state to state, even within the same insurance company, because the laws and regulations can vary so much from state to state!~~I am a tier two for tech support and this is literally half my tier ones.

Your only job is to (1) be polite as you (2)  read the fucking manual to them!!~~I know that this is going to be the situation when my mother dies. She keeps saying she has a policy somewhere, but shes not great with money or paying thing consistently. I know there will be no value when we go to cash it out. Shes lying to us.~~A big enough boo boo can cost a call center location. I worked in one. where a famous hockey player had their cell phone account cancelled for bankruptcy by some new hire thinking it be funny. so policy is you need have an excuse for real to be in any account.

3.0,"I had a manager call recently where this guy (after 45 minutes of me telling him he was in the wrong department for his query) demanded he speak to a manager.

Ended up offline for the rest of the day because it stressed me out so much and was 90 minutes late on my break~~If he had any common sense, he'd see that sending the email while someone's on the phone to maybe figure out why it's not reaching you guys is probably the best option. 

Nope, it's more important to him to waste your time and harass you. Wish we could normalize simply cancelling these types of ""customers"" and putting them on a list.~~I love it. Customer files a formal complaint against you, you simply get some coffee and donuts. Props to your supervisor. It's like callers don't realise call centres have ways of actually listening to the calls and finding out that it was in fact just them being a giant dickhead after all. You handled it well.

Sometimes I get people who call up to say: ""I want to file a complaint against the last person I spoke to."" I'll put it through for them and make a request for our supervisors to listen to the call. If the agent actually did fuck up, then they will probably be sat down and given some advice, but they won't be punished for it - simply helped, which is good and how it should be.~~I once had a guy insist on keeping me on the phone to punish me because he hated my company and since he was an escalation, the usual production metrics didnt apply. He wasnt mad at me he just wanted to tantrum. I remember he wanted my direct line so he could call me the next morning and so it all again because I probably make $100 an hour. I almost peed myself laughing. If I was making$100 an hour at this job, I would have found a fucking direct line for him to call me on and happily sat there doing nothing except muttering there there and oh I cant imagine how frustrating this is.~~I work for a power company.

It wasn't my case so I'm not familiar with all the details but apparently he had a car where you could press a button to break? The car also obviously had pedals as usual. He told us that it's not fair that he needs to pay for the damages because ""he didn't lose control of the vehicle"" as the accident report said, but simply ""didn't know how to break"".~~Dude, I was dialing [redacted] yesterday with [redacted] surveys. One lady legit used 3 separate racial slurs in one call. Asians,   Afghanis, and African Americans. 

""Best"" part of the call? When I asked the demographics question about her own ethnicity, she said ""I'm a normal American, so white."" Wish I were making this shit up.


Edit: I removed some info that might tie me to my work.~~So I work for a somewhat large company with many competitors that do the same thing and we DO NOT brand our calls. I can five minutes into a conversation before realizing its not one of our customers. Infuriating &amp; a waste of everyones time. I do find it funny when people realize theyve contacted the wrong company but still want my assistance. You want to open an account? I cant help with that either, but at least some day when you call I CAN help.~~I do IT for an insurance company, printers and passwords and etc. Absolutely nothing customer based. They somehow get our number and call still. One customer called and just started blathering about whatever, a bill or something. I told her 3 times that she had called the wrong number, that I could not assist her in any way, and she responded ""well thats not MY problem!""

It literally is, tho.~~A lot of people just throw out b.s. threats thinking that they're just some magic phrase to get us to do what he wants. So many company's follow the ""the customer is always right"" motto and do whatever they can to avoid the customer filing a complaint so that customer then thinks they can do that whenever they're not getting their way and suddenly all their problems will disappear. 

I've had people threaten to go to the news or the BBB (Better Business Bureau - I think the BBB is the American equivalent of FOS for you) because we tell them no for something. I just tell them okay and leave it at that. I doubt the local news is going to care about the fact that we told you, you have to wait for the repair shop to open before we'll tow your vehicle from their lot because you don't have a receipt to prove you don't owe them money.~~I hold an insurance license as well, the amount of times people don't understand that yes accidents follow you not the vehicle or your policy, dumbest I've had was a guy who got a quote online, I went through more detailed questions and his premium went up to 8K. He's like well my current company will do it for $4500. I'm like ok that's great that means you have an endorsement that is giving you accident forgiveness for the accident there that if you switch insurers you will be rated for.

Guy could not understand that when you change insurers stuff that's on your record gets rated for. People are just stupid sometimes~~I work at a credit union. I cant count the number of times we have members who want to close their accounts and open a new one so they can avoid paying back places like Cashland for their loans. To discourage the practice we charge a $25 fee for unnecessarily performing closed/reopens that arent due to fraud. These type of people always try to claim but I didnt give them pErMiSsIoN to debit my account. Not buying it Karen/Chad. You signed their agreements. You freely have them your account info and borrowed the funds. Pay the money back or permanently close your account. We arent going to help facilitate your fraudulent activities~~Monday I woke up and quit my call center job. I'd been in various call centers for 7 years and I just woke up and realized if I had to take one more angry phone call I was legitimately going to have a nervous breakdown. Good for you for realizing its not for you before it breaks you!~~I'm reminded of one of James Herriot's (alias Alf Wight's) stories of a farmer claiming one of his cows was hit by lightning. The insurance company hired Mr Herriot  to do an autopsy, turns out the cow died from heart failure. One of the lines was the vet saying there hadn't been a storm on the day in question, and the farmer arguing that there had been.

(Another such case looked open and shut, with a black line burnt into the skin from an ear to the ground. Mr Farnon (James' boss) took a close look, clapped the farmer on the shoulder and said ""What a pity you let the candle grease fall on the skin."")~~Dear lord. I work in auto insurance and calls like this are the bane of my existence. In Massachusetts per state regulations we cannot cancel your policy unless we have proof you've canceled your plates or obtained other insurance. In Florida we can't cancel it within the first 60 days unless we have proof you have another policy. In North Carolina we need a written request. No, we are not just making up rules to fuck with you, that's based on the rules your state has set for auto insurance. I understand you don't like it but don't spend an additional 20 minutes on the line telling me it's not fair. There's nothing I can do about it. If you don't like the rules please just move to Kansas and stop calling me.~~I had a Sam not that long ago in January who likes to pay his bill on the last day of the billing period after the daily cutoff and then wonders why his is reported past due each month.  

Then got him again at the end of February basically repeating the entire process all over again.  Still sticking with the ""not his fault/problem"" line.  Leaving a manager in tears this time after the escalation.

Sam makes me lose all faith in humanity ever evolving to the next level decent civilization.  All one can hope for is their constant state of self entitled aggressive attitude leads to high blood pressure and an early heart attack.~~So you can just remove someone from their insurance without their consent with the foreknowledge of the police being called on them? And also add a friend as a 'partner' again with full knowledge of this...

Pretty bad practice in my opinion. Not to say the guy deserves a break, just a weird system.~~I worked for an pharmacy insurance plan and had an agent with a member call me and start to berate because only wal-mart sold a product at low cost. She was yelling at me because the member had to drive through a bad part of town to get wal-mart. She was telling the customer to go to the wal-mart that was close to college I attended and was complaining it was too far away, and she was using backroads only a dumbass would use. I started to give her turn by turn directions to the more local wal-mart and the member just literally told her to shut up and give him the phone.  He thanked me for my time and disconnected the call. 

One wal-mart was across the street from the store I worked at in college and the other was down the road from the college. The member lived two blocks from my house. They were all within 15/20 minutes.~~I dunno why people are being so uppity. My car insurance is doing the same thing citing a lower amount of driving we are presumably doing. I'm just taking it as a sweet bonus, because I still need car insurance like??? Someone could still hit my car while it's sitting in the driveway~~",The commenter had a manager call where the caller demanded to speak to a manager after 45 minutes of them telling him they were in the wrong department for his query. The commenter ended up offline for the rest of the day because it was too stressful and the caller didn't know how to handle the
3.0,"Lmaoo I once had a lady tell me that she hopes my day is as rotten as her trash smells.  I work for a trash company and she had put out late and missed us, so was wanting us to come back. Not with that attitude ya dumb bitch. Enjoy holding that smelly trash for another week. ~~I has something similar the other day. Except I work in lvl 2 support for a bank.

Specialist calls through saying a customer is calling us back after putting a block on his card because he lost it during his trip to the supermarket.

 He initially told us he picked it up from the front desk and when advised we need to cancel and replace it he went off his rocket.
After calming down he advised that he found it rolled up in a receipt and not the front desk.

Apparently he told us the first story because he thought we wouldn't have to cancel it if that was the case.

The man terminated the call and called back hoping for a different response but the first specialist left notes of the story on his profile.

People amaze me sometimes..~~Some customers are willfully ignorant. I work in billing and payments and the number of customers that say I dont even check my monthly bill or I didnt read the contract like okay Im sorry you have piss poor personal finance choices, thats not on me. You are responsible for that.~~I had a guy come into our live chat to report a system he purchased wasn't working. I requested his account information to pull him up and asked what the issue was.

He tells me that his daughter spilled water all over it and shorted it out.  I informed him that unfortunately the warranty doesn't cover accidental damage, tries to argue that I should ignore what he said because what if it didn't happen like that. 

For the next 10 minutes he kept trying to claim what he said wasn't true,  even though I explained that in this very chat you've already stated it happened and then changed the story multiple times. Since it's on your account the chat is logged and will be seen and we'll not be able to cover.~~Ive actually had something similar to this happen. I work at a store and they expect us to push the store credit card. One time I ask this woman if shed like to open one. 

She says her credit is terrible but she could probably open one for her mother because shes dependent on her and has better credit. Im like they have to be here to open a card. She doesnt understand why she cant open a credit card in her mothers name without her mothers permission or knowledge. 

People are so fucking stupid.

Edit: credit card not restaurant~~Ugh! I used to be an insurance producer in a call center. I *hated* when people would assume that I could access account information with other carriers. Wtaf, in what field can one company access the private information of another company? You have to sign a form just to move your health records to a new doctor. You just called my ass, why tf do you think I can access protected, private information with just a verbal approval over the phone when I have practically no way to truly verify who you are??~~I wouldn't have wasted a supe's time on that. 
""We do send them out and they are accessible online. We can't make her carry them with her, we can only provide her the resources to carry them.""     

In response to the idiotic questions. ""My car was stolen, or I need a tow. Can't you just activate your GPS device and find it?""

""Uh no. We never installed one on your car and even if that was possible and we had requested to do so you would have remembered and/or pitched a fucking fit.""~~Way to stick it to him! Also, can you please elaborate more on the pros and cons of keeping phone insurance if you don't have a history of breaking/losing phones? I've been debating for a while now to drop my $11/month insurance plan on my Google pixel 3, but I'm too paranoid to commit even though I've never broken/lost a phone (knock on wood lol).~~Sounds about right! One of my colleagues yesterday had a customer asking for extra time to make his payment because hes spent a lot on Christmas. If hed just stopped at Im struggling to make the payment we would have been able to help with an extension, but in this case his lack of planning for an event that happens at the same time every year is not our fault.~~Its either the wrong last name or address. 

So many people insist they have NEVER used another address EVER, yet after several minutes of explaining I am unable to locate their acct they end up saying Well why dont you try my PO box or Try my last address, I just moved six months ago. or Well all my mail goes to my moms address so maybe try that?

INFURIATING!~~It sounds like you're in the USA, your system is similar to ours in Australia. I used to be an agent, it really is shit work. I'm a broker now and have been for about ten years. 

It's far more satisfying, and financially rewarding.

In Australia, an agent acts for and represents the insurance companies best interest, while a broker represents the clients best interest. It's our job to not only shop around and get the best deal, but also to maximise their claim payouts.~~When I worked in credit card customer service, I had this darling call in one day asking when she'd be getting more money. 2 month old account, $2k limit, already maxed out. I said something like, ""Um, you can use your card again when you've paid off some of the balance you've built up..."" Old lady flipped. Had no idea she owed back the funds spent on the credit card. Had no idea what a credit card was. Kept insisting we *owed* her another $2k of free money....

8 years later, I still can't decide if she was playing the fool or if she was really that stupid.... ~~This is always an agonizing decision for me.  Letter of the law for my team is judgement within 3 to 5 minutes.  But we also have a within-two-hours repeat calls stat, and such a high percentage of these people will call right back in when they get back from whatever shiny thing distracted them.  It's really a lose-lose situation for us. ~~That's kinda insane! So you're telling us there are people who get paid, among other tasks, to go to car shows and check the plates to see if they have declared the modifications to their insurance???

Because i doubt an insurance agent went to a car show in their free time, remembered a plate number and what kind of car it was declared as, and then reported it. I mean, it's not impossible, but it sounds unlikely.~~It must be frustrating asking somebody if theyve read a document knowing that your companys lawyers wrote said document in such a way as to obfuscate, confuse, and coerce. Question: When people call you, how often are they calling you so you can explain those documents in plain English? Im sorry you have to do that.~~Ugh. Yes. I swear, I have this call once a week. Sometimes the people that call aren't surprised at all, and those are the nice, understanding ones. But we often get the ones like this who demand to know exactly what happened and when, and I'm not allowed to tell them due to privacy laws. It's the worst.~~hahahahaha.

Something very similar to this happened at my work this week, we work in health insurance.

Coworker called to check eligibility on the member's other plan with another health insurance company. Rep at the other company said she couldn't verify my coworker because she wasn't able to find her employee information in her system.

""I don't work with you. I work for Teacups. We are a different heath insurance company!""

Coworker ended up having to ask for a supervisor. LOL~~Today I had an older gentleman tell me that he was gonna no straight to the media on Tuesday if we didnt meet his demands by Monday.  I thanked him for bringing his concerns to our attention, told him that his memo as he called it had been turned over to our legal team.  Theyd be in touch with him if they felt there was a response. 

I cant wait for the promised media shitstorm a retired 70something gentleman from the Midwest kicks up.~~Had a customer forward an email to us once that was meant to bend to his will because it was from his MP.

He didnt edit it very well because the MP had told him that following the customers repeated contact regarding spurious complaints and taking the MP to the parliamentary ombudsman 12 times (none of which were upheld) the MP politely asked him not contact them anymore.~~Im a black male in the IT field as an IT manager in Texas.  Ive setup my own interviews sometimes because of deadlines and I needed techs.  
My voice is deep and southern but not too southern.  My wife says it sounds friendly.

So when people meet me face to face they are surprised and you can see it all over their face when I say who I am and that Ill be conducting the interview.  
One guy told me you look different then what I pictured.  I said oh, how so?  The guy said I thought you would be shorter.    Smooth real, smooth.  He didnt get the job because he was under qualified, but we had a nice 30 minute conversation on guns and country life.
LMAO!~~Your system gives a notice?!? I went 3 months without making a mortgage payment as it never tells you if it fails. Reason why? The property tax went up by 3 cents, so the system didnt pull anything.

Luckily 1) mortgage is paid from an account outside of my usual spending (bills and food), 2) Bank removed any late fees, 3) after adding 9 cents, they were able to get the amount in full for all missed payments.

I never would have noticed as I have my employer split my check into accounts (mortgage/spending/savings) for me if it wasnt for a call center employee informing me.~~""I was on the phone with someone else in your department and they SWORE to me that all they needed to do was push ONE BUTTON and it would be fixed, and if any agent told me differently they would be LYING, but then the call disconnected... if you don't help me I will contact the governor and also sue you personally.""

every day of my life.~~&gt;...she precedes to keep going about outsourcing

Why do people not understand that it's the companies fault for outsourcing to save a few bucks. If it's a call centre full of people who are barely capable of following the flow chart with impenetrable accents it's because they were cheaper and the company is living the capitalist dream~~Can you not delete it? If it isn't on her MVR and there's no reason it should be on her CLUE report then why are y'all factoring it in?

If your company didn't make a payment, it shouldn't be on her CLUE report. My company allows us to delete these from our system.~~","The commenter had a bad experience with a customer who wanted them to come back to pick up their trash. The customer initially claimed to have picked up their card from the front desk, but later informed them that it was actually rolled up in a receipt. The commenter was frustrated with the customer's"
3.0,"Had this happen before where I could see the cause of a problem immediately but because the customer wanted done his way by 'someone who knows better' (read as supervisor who will ask me what to do) he had to wait on the timeout line for a supervisor. (Timeout line is literally an infinite hold till a supervisor cares enough to take a 'stupid' call)~~Being threatened with a lawyer is the same as the Better Business Bureau. We don't care.

Today I was threatened by a guy who called himself a doctor and said that we were poisoning people with our water bottles. He was writing an article about it to expose us.

An article!

I had to put him on mute.~~We had a TV program here in the UK about insurance fraud and it really is amazing and shocking the lengths people will go to to con money out of insurance companies. One I watched had someone claim that their luggage was lost after a flight they took, they said there was an iPad as well as other expensive things in the case at the time it was 'lost',  they were asked to provide photos, which they did, unfortunately they failed to realise that when you take a digital photo it has information that tells them when the picture was taken amongst other stuff and they took the picture the same day they phoned the insurance company. Yeah stupid right? You can guess what happened next... also the police are informed so not only do they fail at fraud they also get in serious trouble for it.~~All of our policies and claims are marked confidential to prevent this exact thing. We have sister offices. So if I work in New York, and my sister office is in Los Angeles, The only office that can handle a policy change for me, or a claim for me is the office in Los Angeles. And we handle all of the work for employees of the Los Angeles office. Chicago, Miami, Houston etc can't even see that we have claims or policies.~~""The customer is always right"" is bullshit!  Always has been.  People (especially mgmt) seem to forget that ""We Reserve The Right To Refuse Service To Anyone, For Any Reason.""  is perfectly legitimate, and the saying/motto businesses *should* follow.  As long as the majority of the consumers stay with your business, and are satisfied, the minority won't matter.  The ""The customer is always right"" crowd will only lose you money, why kiss their asses?! ((But ""they"" still do, ""apply lip balm and pucker up""))

ADD:  yeah, I know ""The customer is always right""  is *supposed* to mean basically ""supply what the customer wants"".  But when customers use the phrase it's completely different, that is what I'm referring to.~~Gotta love people like this. From my understanding of what my wife's told me in her time at an insurance company, joke really is on that guy, depending on the state (if in the states)... that would technically classify him as uninsured and, potentially, raise his rates at other companies for being an uninsured driver... if I've got that right anyway?

It'd be a shame if you just paid your bills and owned up to a mistake. /shrug~~Before my company change the verification questions, we had to ask for the whole property address. I swear it was like pulling teeth. Example; lady calls in I get her loan number her full name and I ask for her property address. She gives me 123 Fake street and the city, state and zip code? Marion, and the state and zip code? Texas the zip code? Oh 12345, why didnt you ask for the whole address? I did maam. I asked for the whole property address.~~We have someone like that, someone who calls us up about once or twice a month and he's alright if you tell him what he wants to hear but the second you don't he goes from interrupting motormouth to angry pedant.

Every month we get an email about him and his habits of hanging up to get different CSR's when they give him answers he doesn't like and we even have a separate script for him.~~I can't say what you do or do not have access to, but I'd google a number and give it to them since they obviously don't know what they're looking for.

I worked on the Samsung Note 7 Recall Team for a while and sometimes people would call in asking about their booking for an airline.~~Ohhhhhh yeah. health insurance plan. Need to be physically present in the country for certain periods of time to be eligible.

The amount of people who try to backtrack from 'I've been abroad for a year' to 'well, I was gone for 7 years from 2000-2007 and no one made a big deal about it then!' Thus providing me with a reason to cancel their coverage from 2000 instead with no way to help them recover and inform them they've committed health insurance fraud (though unintentional) is absolutely astonishing.

Please, please, please READ THE AGREEMENT YOU SIGN FOR ANY INSURANCE. THERE ARE RULES.

My job would be so much better if people knew how to read things before they signed them.~~I had a client burn through a week of rental time because he refused to authorize repairs. He wanted us to write off his 2019 vehicle because of DV.

What happened to the vehicle? A tree branch fell on it and slightly damaged the door frame. The door wouldn't seal properly. The cost of repairs was 35% of the value of his vehicle.

I cut off the rental since he was stalling, and then he authorized the repairs. When he went over his rental allowance and asked me to cover the extra time, I declined to do so. When his broker called to ask me to cover the extra rental time, I explained how he used up a week, trying to force us to write off a very repairable vehicle.~~I also work in insurance claims and this is just my life man. No one ever reads their insurance paperwork and always dispute having an excess/deductible because they pay their premiums.  Then they get shirty when they cause a multi car pile up and refuse to pay said excess.... so we don't cover the claim and warn them that the other parties and/or their insurers are going to want them to pay all of their costs too. They still refuse to pay, declaring ""what do I even pay insurance for?! You won't cover anything!!"" 


Next call in is customer asking why insurer A, insurer B , independent party 1 and dodgy hire car company 1 are all asking for bills in the thousands to cover repairs and hire cars etc when customer has insurance and was clearly told no excess would apply on the last call?? 

Bruh...~~Insurance is made unnecessarily complex with loophole and add ons that infuriate anyone who isn't familiar with it.  

That said, the phone agents don't set policy.  I know I have asked for things that are unreasonable because I don't know the system.  I ask nicely and accept a no answer. I've been pleasantly surprised a few times.~~I worked a summer at Steak n Shake and once had a table who thought their milkshakes were taking too long to come out. Maybe they were right, doesn't matter to the story. 

What does matter is that another server came along and, without knowing anything except the customer complaint, told them they could get their milkshakes for free. 

Which normally would have been fine. But in this case they didn't order milkshakes by themselves. They ordered the shake/ burger meal. So we couldn't just comp the shakes without either comping the meal or instead charging them for burgers they ordered, essentially saving them a few dollars for the entire table. 

The manager wasn't amused. ~~I used to sell life insurance. At one consult I was with a current customer reviewing his coverage. He was older and very underinsured (like one $1,000 policy) so I suggest a bit more to cover all final life expenses and he said, ""I've never even used this insurance! Why would I buy more?"" 

I just said, ""Of course you haven't used it, you haven't died."" 

He did not buy more. Lol~~QA manager here. I just wrapped up my end of year prizes. We gave away a bunch of gift cards. The categories were: most improved QA scores, highest score for the year, knowledge base usage, most productive KB author. Cards ranged from $10 - $50 and there was more than one winner for some of the categories.  I would never, ever allow throwing out a low score. That helps no one and fucks with morale. Sorry OP, that really sucks. ~~We get this a lot in the cellular industry. Someone gets pissed and wants to cancel but doesn't set up an account with the new carrier and cancel over port out. and they won't listen when you try and explain the process to them. They then freak out because they lost their phone number. It's even worse when it's their business line. I guess they needed new business cards/stationary and to call everyone on their customer or vendor lists anyway.~~Im constantly telling my husband that I cant deal with companies that are under his name only, he insists I need to take care of something under his name and I I have to tell him AGAIN that hell have to do it because unless he puts me on the account they wont deal with me. Youd think after nearly 21 years hed get it. 

My husband is a slow learner at times.~~I too work in insurance but in claims. I had a woman call me for a claim already in progress (assigned an adjuster) but she want me to make sure it was a MALE who came out to inspect. I...uh...what? Had to call supervisor line to see if that's doable. We are both women and horrified. Supervisor just said to put it in the notes as request and move on.~~&gt;Am I the only one that make sure to call the right place, account number in hand before giving private information?

I work at a hotel.  I once had someone try to give me their social security number over the phone.

People are way less careful with their information than they should be.~~Man, I couldn't do that for 45 minutes. It would have just been, ""You didn't pay so you have no policy with us. Buh bye.""

We had a fire in the apartment building a few years ago. Had been diligent but that month we happened to be behind one month, so the phone call was like, ""Hey can I pay this?"" ""Ok, good you have money. Now can I file a claim?"" XD Haven't been behind since.~~This kind of BS is why I don't give out my name, Frankly you don't need to know it as everything is tracked internally anyways. I'll give my badge number but fuck you if you think I'm giving out my first and last name to randos who are in many cases VERY unhappy with the news I have to deliver.~~Lmao! So in the end she ended up owing you guys money?? Oh wow, that makes me so very happy as someone who has worked in customer service. I am just sitting here, still smiling ear to ear, at the thought of her triumphant smile falling right off of her stupid smug face.~~","The commenter shares a personal experience of being threatened with a lawyer by a customer who falsely claimed to be a doctor.

3.0,"I feel this in my soul. Also I hate the people that think 1. If they give me a police report/case number I can just instantly pull it up and get all of the information from it (I can't, I can order it through LexisNexis which may take up to 8 weeks, or you can get off your lazy ass and go get it from the police yourself)  2. That a police report is the same as a claim somehow (and thus answer ""yes"" when asked if a claim was already started when there wasn't) or 3. That all insurance carriers somehow share a centralized claim system, and a claim number from progressive is just fine to give someone from Geico when asked what their claim number is.~~I handled CAT claims in the US for a while. It was May and an insured claimed that a hurricane blew a barrel off of a bridge into her vehicle. I advised her several times that we didnt see any hurricanes reported in the area and she insisted there was one and it damaged her car. Pulled the weather reports (85, sunny, no winds) for that whole week and she was referred for fraud. People arent the brightest. Had another claim where a pastor was claiming hail damage to his 20 year old vehicle in CA. There hadnt been a hail storm in 28 years in the area. ~~It's so strange to see this post because I've been wondering how much dental procedure like crown would cost but when I call the insurance company, I'm not going to know exactly what all would need to be done so it feels like it would be a wast of everyone's time to even call. Idk...~~It amazes me how casually people will just make comments/jokes like this to complete strangers.

I was on a call once and a man, who was upset that I informed him about having to pay a cleaning fee upon check out. In a half-angry, half-joking way, he said something along the lines of, ""I'm just going to blow my fucking head off in your hotel, give you something to clean off."". This was about 3 weeks after my dad had committed suicide by gunshot to his head. I was so taken back, I ended up just bursting into tears over the phone.

I had to leave work early, it was incredibly embarrassing, I'd been really good at keeping it together at work, but that just really winded me. I don't understand why people think sort of thing is just okay to say.~~When I worked in insurance many moons ago a famous person died unexpectedly and tragically. Her fianc was unable to access her home insurance policy because of all the advisers who were looking at it and they werent supposed to.I believe at least half a dozen people were sacked for that. Of course why wasnt  his priority making insurance claim the day she died?~~A coworker at my old job had a call with a rude, obnoxious and kind of racist customer. At the end of the call when my coworker had fixed his issue the guy said ""Well, it's been nice talking to you.""

My coworker responded with his usual customer service smile ""Well I wish I could say the same. Have a nice day."" and hung up.

He was almost certain he would get reported for that one. And he considered it to have been worth it. But nothing ever came of it.~~Ahahah yes I do a pretty a similar job to what you do and those are my favorite moments. Kind of similar... I had a lady lit up mad wanting to make all these changes saying she called and called and the agent never answered or called back. I removed her son and his vehicle backdating to a note on the policy from her first call. This was a 19 day backdate. She also wanted to remove a vehicle that was on comp only and she wanted it backdated. I couldnt do that without underwriting approval because she still owned the vehicle. She was furious and going on and on about how it wasnt fair and I really enjoyed explaining that at $35 premium for a 6 month term going back 19 days would result in maybe a $3-$4 refund. She was dumbfounded and told me not to worry about it and just remove it effective it todays date lol ~~I mean, just tell em it was your fault. Human error, it happens. You thought you had the right of way and the space but didnt. Oh well.

But to claim the officer is racist cause he wanted to get the semi truck drivers statement first, the guy who works for a big company delivering freight that is now behind schedule, is laughable.~~I work for a car insurance company that is also doing a refund/credit. The number of people yelling at me bc it hasnt been applied to their account yet is insane. Its also mostly the people that havent paid since February complaining about how we arent doing enough. Like youve had TWO extra months to pay your premium, WITHOUT a lapse on insurance, but go off.~~Ive just sent your registered cell phone a txt 
My computer isnt on
No. A txt. To your cell 
Which email address did u send it to
I sent it to your cell. As a txt. 
But Im using my landline 
I cant send info to youd landline 
Why not~~I work as a phone jockey and live in the UK, so a double whammy of not exactly sure how this insurance system works.

But I understand perfectly that each company, while being backed by the same firm, cover ***very specific terms***. I'm going to make a wild guess that one is personal injury and the other is liability? Which she just didn't seem to get the grasp of.~~I work agent support for a large insurance company.  I wish I could take the licenses of some of the idiots that call us :/  (Like the guy that barely speaks english, calls that he didn't get a fax, speaks gibberish, yells he got the fax, hangs up, then calls back saying he still didn't get it).

4.0,"It's actually not unreasonable: The whole system is screwed up.

if you go to a tire shop, the mechanic doesn't bill you separately.

If you go to the supermarket, the cashier doesn't bill you separately.

And yet if you went to the hospital and there were no doctors there would be no reason to go.

So it's not unreasonable that people don't understand that screwed up concept.~~I would be astounded if there was even a tiny sliver of truth in her story. Lies/scams often appeal to your emotions and require instant action so you don't have a chance to verify anything. 

This isn't how a criminal investigation is handled. You shielded your customer from someone attempting to steal protected information.~~Oh god, I love it when they say shit like this.

&gt;Don't tell me, I used to be a nurse!

I work in broadband tech so I get ""I work with computers"" or ""I'm an engineer myself"" when they disagree with you about something basic like switching the router off or moving it from behind their TV.

That's when you hit them with the ""oh, I see! So you understand why it needs to be done then!""

""Oh, uh, well...""

What is their plan? That they'll say they work in the same industry and instead of going through process, instead we'll change it to fit them? Get fucked.~~&gt;It always blows my mind when patients make suggestions for our business while perpetuating the very reason we dont do those suggestions....

I think I see the problem. You think she wants you to keep random spots open so people can reschedule sooner. She doesn't want that, she wants you to keep availability for *her*. Other people are just an inconvenience.~~Doesn't want to risk catching it and spreading it to the dumb parents. What a champion. By dumb I just mean not allowing the kid to get it. If they don't want it that's on them but don't force your refusal on others that's just as bad as those wanting a vaccine mandate.~~She should have just hung up with you and waited a bit. As soon as she got the next person, just lie about a big change to get the other plan, that way its on her for lying to call center staff for fraud and not the call center itself.

Unless you put the notes in for her to prevent her from doing it.~~I had someone yesterday so angry that we hadn't received the fax she sent us. I am working with her to try to make sure we can get the info and we got to the point for the case number. She had two numbers transposed and even after correcting her and her realizing she had the wrong case number she still kept ranting to me about how we didn't receive the info.....yeah because you put the wrong case number on your paperwork -_-~~Oh god yes. I work in a medical call center that schedules doctors appointments. The endocrinology office never has any appointments available until 3 - 4 months out. Patients wait to call to cancel an hour before and then get mad when the next appointment is 3 or 4 months out. Like why would that change from when you originally made the appointment?~~Im a diabetic and it makes no sense to me why he wouldnt be able to use a food bank. Either way, while I do suspect that he was bluffing, seemingly hopeless situations like that can absolutely drive someone to the edge like that and calling for a welfare check was definitely the right call. Im sorry today was sucked!~~I used to work in a dispensary(legal state for people over 21) and the law is that you have to show a valid ID to be in the building regardless of whether youre purchasing or not and the only people who would get mad at me were the 45+ crowd. Like, yes, I can clearly see that youre over 21, the law doesnt care how old you look, they want a VALID ID. We literally had a sign on the door that said must show valid ID to enter, 21+ only. People under 45 had no problem showing me though. Some of them seemed flattered we asked.~~I had a similar situation once! I also work in health insurance (in Australia tho) and this dudes claim had been rejected bc the provider had forgotten to stamp the invoice with their details. 
Me: youll need to go back to the provider and get them to stamp the invoice, then resubmit for payment 
Him: what if I just went to the store, bought a stamp, and did it myself?
Me: well I guess you could do that, but thats illegal and youve just said it on a recorded line so....~~The two illegal things that occurred during or before this call:

1. &gt;!The CSR was listening into the conversation without letting me know he was present. This is made worse by the fact that HIPAA-protected information was being exchanged between myself and the caller.!&lt;
2. &gt;!Because the CSR is neither licensed nor appointed to do business, it was unlawful for them to share plan details, to look up medications, or to recommend a plan. Even I have to transfer a call to another agent if I get a call from a state I'm not licensed in (and I'm licensed in 27 currently). We are not permitted to discuss any plan specific information without a valid license and appointment for the caller's state.!&lt;~~I had one wanting a call from his doctor after hours. I asked for his call back number and he went on a 5 minute rant how he will not give me his number so I can sell it to telemarketers. I told the caller I would inform the oncall that he should have your number. The doctor called me back and said....I don't have his number. I informed the doctor that the patient refused to give it to me due to telemarketers. I did record the number on caller ID and gave it to the doctor. A little while later the doctor called me back and told me that he informed the patient that in the future he must give HIS answering service his number or there will be no call back. People are so weird.~~&gt; Me: Sorry ma'am but due to HIPAA laws, I need three identifiers in order to access your chart and verify your identity.

Me:  The Law requires me to ask that question, if you cannot answer it, I cannot access your chart.  Would you like to call back at a different time?

Don't make it your reponsibility to call her back, maker her call you.  Also don't apologize for following the law.~~If her story was true, and that info really would help, they would have subpoenaed it before even calling to ask you. Dont risk your job when it's a simple process on the other end. Its also fishy shes calling herself, and not the detective. The whole story reeks of being false~~I dont understand this you cant tell me what to do over masks.  We are told what side of the road to drive on, to wear seat belts, to stop at stop signs, to pull over when we see emergency vehicles, how fast we can go, where to drive (ie: not on the sidewalk) and that is just driving!  We have rules *everywhere*.  Why pick masks as the step too far?~~In my call center after we explain something a few times if the caller keeps going back to it we can say to them that I have already explained that and the reason we cant do it. Do you have any other items that you need help with or can I consider this completed?~~Wow. Sounds like it's time to go even higher, and point out how much money they are waisting away doing this. How your department needs more people, and the people that are here need to be punished into termination for being that waistful, to include those that refuse to do anything about it.~~Oh I hear ya.    Worked for a surgeon and got this all the time.    There were times this guy was double and triple booked just to fit everyone in, but the number of people complaining cos he didn't consult out if office hours.....so glad I don't have to deal with those phone calls anymore!~~Ill never forget the guy that called in for an auto insurance quote and when I asked about anyone else in his home that would need to be listed as a driver he replies, well wouldve been my idiot disappointment of a son if I didnt have to kick him out and disown him for marrying a black chick.... excuse me sir I AM a black chick engaged to a white man. Suddenly my foot slipped on the power cord and my whole computer shut off... technical difficulties still no regrets ~~Mmmhhh this screams scam to me. I really doubt the cops would have her call her husband's dentist, whom she does not know. I'm fairly confident there's more official channels to get that info than ""have the grieving widow call her insurance company"". 

More likely she's trying to stalk him or screw him some how. You made the right decision.~~Don't feel bad, this was 100% a lie.  If this information was truly required to help solve a murder, the detectives would be contacting you.  Not the *wife of the deceased*, jesus.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm guessing it's a lot more likely that either he's a shitbag husband and/or she's a crazy jealous wife, he told her that he was at the dentist, she doesn't believe him thinks he is cheating, and is trying to find out who his dentist is so that she can pester them to confirm his whereabouts.  Or something along those lines.  But her murder story is total bullshit.~~I work in mental health claims... I feel you for sure! But I pay their bills! Nope. They are a dependent on my taxes! Nope. Its my f- insurance! Nope. People need to have a better understanding how insurance works, and not give attitude. I for real am not losing my job and getting a HIPAA violation for your dumbass. Its not hard to have your spawn talk into the phone and give verbal consent for the call.~~I hate the fact that people call back multiple times asking for the same thing. I used to work at a bank on the phones, and so many people would call back right after speaking to someone. If I spoke to them second I would just copy the other agents notes because I would tell them the same damn thing. It's like they don't believe the first answer they got and just want to try again to get a 'better' answer...~~I had a lady trying to add her son and his new car to her insurance. She didnt like the price, and wanted to know what it would be if she were driving it. Since her son was 19, and she was 50-something, of course she liked that price more. She said she wanted to put herself as the driver, and I informed her that that would be fraud, and she swore at me and the  hung up. I was typing up my notes when I noticed that there was activity on her account starting about two minutes after my call ended. The wretched bitch hung up on me and called back trying to get a rep who didnt know it was her sons car. I messaged the new rep internally and sent him the entire story from my notes. Your move bitch.~~",The commenter believes that the situation described in the post is not unreasonable due to the fact that the system is broken.

This is sometimes misunderstood for not having enough knowledge since i'm asking ""so many questions"".  They also say "" it does not work, just fix it"". Sometimes they think they know how everything works but they don't. I can soak up alot from my clients but if they start questioning my expertise i can get snappy. I'm thinking to myself if you know how to fix it yourselves then fix it and let me do my job.~~Ugh. I book appointments sometimes too and people are crazy.
We do phone appointments and people want in person appointments or after banking hours (evenings and weekends) or they don't want their appointment with their assigned manager because they're not white or ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH. (Sometimes they out right say that and I can refuse to book but sometimes it's passive aggressive and if they dont out right say anything we can't refuse)

I once got a guy who didn't want a daytime appointment but booked it anyway to ""waste your time like you're wasting mine"" and was rather annoyed when no one called him and we sent more reminders to him. (I pre-warned his manager and his manager told him not to call)

I'll be glad when we stop doing these appointments in January.~~It's the same in the UK (obviously not about healthcare) with benefits - they blame all the immigrants and migrants for taking 'British jobs'. Jobs that they won't do as they're too good for them or if they do work they'll lose too much because the benefits system is rubbish.  Brexit didn't help as much was made about migrants. It's rhe same everywhere xx~~I understand your frustration and know that many people who deal with customers actually want to help. However I have been n the other side of that call many times and have been bounced from one call center to another, had to repeat my information every time and then get cut off when I was transferred to the next person. 

Sometimes I think these companies purposely make it hard if not impossible to contact someone who can actually fix their problem hoping they will just give up.~~I work in the pest control industry and we have to talk to people like this every day. Delusional parasitosis is the mental issue. No amount of calm and rational reasoning will work. I have taken the route of sharing my deep sympathy for what they are dealing with and letting them know how much I wish more research could be done to help them. Of course they think I mean for their ""pest"" problem but I mean more research into mental health disorders.~~I get this as a hairstylist, too! I stay booked out for at least two months. My regulars know to book their appointments in advance(some are booked til the end of the year!). I love getting new clients, but its sometimes hard to get them in as soon as they want. Most of the time theyre cool and are willing to wait for me, but Ive had some that just get pissy! I cant add hours in the day! And I can only work so much before I get pissy:)~~My favorites are when I need to schedule an appointment for people and they tell me what day they want (usually the next day or two). I have to tell them that I have to see whats available first (usually the earliest appt nearing 30 days). People think appointment slots magically open for them.~~This whole month has been me telling people that I can't give them what they want. Sure, I sell cruises, so a bit more fun than medical needs, but I still have people calling in for Christmas and new year cruises for THIS YEAR, and they get surprised that we're booked solid. I even had one lady tell me ""sold out!? I thought that was a myth!""~~I know it isnt directly related to this situation but I never tell customers that a colleague is at lunch. They are always in a meeting (which is true, it is a vital catch up with food and fresh air). Plus they are more forgiving if the colleague isnt able to look into the matter the second they return.~~This is incredibly common w insurance companies. They basically have a google type directory. They type in your zip code and give you a list. Last time I tried to use that particular service they gave me 4 names. 1 was out of business, 2 weren't taking patients and the 4th wasnt even accepting that insurance anymore. It's not your fault at all. It's the insurance company doing it.~~Same goes for heart valves, pacemakers, stents, etc.  In the case of these items the person that had them implanted would also have a card that tells the manufacturer detail, serial, etc so if it was a case of them having a body and them having one of these cards that was in a Jane/John Doe's house they could link them without getting the manufacturer involved.  Because breast implants aren't a potential danger in an MRI the person that has them wouldn't have one of these cards as the cards are there mostly so the person can hand it to an MRI tech before getting scanned to make sure the device is imaged safely (or not done if it's unsafe).  ~~Idk how important it is to get braces ASAP but she could've waited until open enrollment to change it. At most the kid would be waiting a year and it doesn't seem like a year would fuck up their teeth that much more, beyond just having to wear the braces a bit longer probably.~~I'm sorry you, the clinic and the doctor had that stress.  Self-centered doesn't even begin to cover the problems with that patient.  This is a global pandemic.  It's mutating, which means at any point it could easily become even more lethal than it is already.  Masking is an incredibly easy way to significantly slow the spread of this virus.  The patient merely exposed themself for the pathetically ego-centric idiot they truly are and I'm delighted the doctor stood up for everyone working at the clinic and barred this individual.  As you said, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.~~Yeah they think we just made up these HIPAA questions.. like lady.. I dont actually care about this stuff.. Im required by FEDERAL LAW to ask it!!! Or when I ask what symptoms theyre having they get all secretive.. again.. Im not being nosy.. I need this information to triage you properly... its for your own good!!~~In my experience, most towns have at least one 24 hour pharmacy that you can get emergency prescriptions filled at, and if there are no urgent care offices open to get a short prescription at, if the person cannot go without it, you can get it at the ER. Although with 4 days remaining and the doctor being open on Monday, the entitled daughter was overreacting majorly, but I just thought I'd add that if a family member is really committed to getting the patient their medication, there are plenty of after hours ways to make it happen.~~I used to work at a bank call center. One security question we had was drivers license number which people would blow a gasket at.

I dont want to give you my license number but Ill give you my social! was common. Also, do you guys even have that? Dude, why the fuck would I even ask you if we didnt?

I cant do shit with your drivers license number. Its little more than filing number with the DMV. Now your social, I can ruin your life with that information.~~I just start speaking over them.
Me: ""Can I please have your phone number?""
Patient: ""041233455667774356677777-""
Me: ""0... 4... 1... 2........ *Pause*""
Patient: ""... 3... 3...""

Repeat until the whole phone number (or whatever) is there and then if they were particularly rude/didn't get it, I repeat the whole thing slowly 'to make sure'.~~lets see....translation - ""Just shut up and let me vent at you and then you can tell me that you're the god-king-emperor of the organization and will fire everyone and I can finally hang up the phone with smug satisfaction that the next time I go in there the new employees will cower with fear!!""~~I think it's just hilarious when people claim that they've never had to go online to look at something but suddenly they have all the info from the website when you get back in the line. It's just so dumb. Obviously you know there is an online element here, why not just look there first?~~I used to work for a bank and my surname is Stevenson, which was apparent as they used to put our names on our desks like a weird game show.

I was filling out a form in front of a customer, on their behalf, and I asked the spelling of their surname. They were being pretty rude and impatient, despite me doing them a favour by completing the form. In a smarmy voice, they told me that their surname was the same as mine, but theirs was spelt the *correct and proper with a PH* way, and gave me a dirty look.

I proceeded to write Phtevenson on the form.~~I feel a bit bad for people travelling, but what do they expect? None of the governments have bolstered their health departments properly, and none of the big things like quarantine stations have been implemented. Health officers have been recommending Gov against the opening up, and its been on the news quite a lot. 

It was obvious we were going to spike for Christmas yet people still go and book holidays and travel. Sure, make plans, but also have the grace to deal with it all going tits up.~~I'm not disagreeing with you. I HATE nosy parents, but just a question;

If a person is 23/25, a student, and unmarried, aren't they still considered a dependent on their parent's health insurance? I know they are for tricare for the military. However, what age does their parent no longer have consent for their info with the above criteria?~~There are 365 days in a year (366 if a leap year) and 7.9 billion people. Some of them will have the same month and day for a birthday. Confirming the date of birth is a normal part of being sure they treat the correct person the correct way. What a hill to (possibly) die on.~~I loooooove working in call centers where you have to verify HIPAA. Had a pharmacist that wanted to transfer a prescription from mail order to retail and didn't know the member's ID or date of birth so I couldn't even look up the person at all and then I get the mail order pharmacist bitching at me for not fully authenticating even though I told her multiple times that I can't pull up the member with just a mail order prescription number like she can. 


I don't like pharmacists.~~","The commenter is a customer service representative (CSR) who is frustrated with customers who don't have enough knowledge and don't want to know what's going on.

4.0,"on your note that people dont listen to messages first...

i now work in a pharmacy and im absolutely astonished by how often that happens! people will just call in and be like i have a missed call from you or i have a voicemail from you and when i ask what it said (you know, so i can actually help them), they freak out and say they didnt listen to it but i should know since i called them. i also dont make outbound calls. 

in those instances, all i can do is check to see if theres an rx ready and say its possible they received an automated alert for that, but until they listen to the voicemail, im not sure which store or which part of the store called them and for what reason. 

ive hated call centers and the phones at this job, but having the same problem over and over again is what ties the awfulness together~~Im related to someone that dumb, maybe dumber. She was told by her doctor to take all of her heart medications (4 or 5), eat a low salt diet, and to go to the gym a whopping 3 days a week to use a stationary bike. This family member has made herself so disabled by not complying shell never ever leave a hospital again as a result.~~/r/TalesFromThePharmacy would love to hear this one.

(Lunch? What is this amazing thing you speak of? I never got a lunch break until I started working at an independent pharmacy. Was working for the Chain of Verylarge Stores once, had a sandwich in one hand and typing at my computer with the other. Customer starts hollering at me, isn't it a violation to eat in a pharmacy? I informed him that yeah, it is, but it's also a violation of the labor law to make me work 14 hours straight with no break, so if he prefers, I can shut down for the mandatory half hour and he can come back later for the prescription he was about to pick up? No? Don't want that? OK, then let me work here and I'll get you out in the next 10 minutes. Yeah, I got an earful from coprorate (sic) about that one.)~~I'm 61 and I don't understand why people around my age cannot use the internet or websites.  Did they never work at a job?  Every job I've ever had used some type of computer system. Even fast food

. Learn one, then another. It just gets to the point where I can figure a new program out myself.~~We have a woman ere in town that....spouts the EXACT same stuff. I mean, word for word. She also claims to have told Neil Armstrong to say the ""one small step"" thing, told Reagan to say ""tear down that wall"",  Is the actual creator of MASH and some other shows...she's a really sick individual and I always hope she gets the help she needs.~~I oversee customer service (you know, where *our own* sales are supposed to be happening), and we get sales calls all freakin day, ""who is the person in charge of maintenance?"" Or ""sales?"" Or ""shipping?"" 

And I'm like, you think I know the names of everyone who works here and what they do? We are just here to take orders from customers.

I don't go to the drive in window at McDonald's and ask to speak to the person in charge of maintenance. They'd be like, ""well, Markus has to mop before he can go home...""~~I saw this the other day when I was at the pharmacy. I've put a lot of my and my brother's medications on automatic refill, and I usually just get a call saying X is ready for pickup. Just one call, definitely not harassment. But apparently some people think that calling to make sure they know their meds are ready is harassment! Or at least the lady in line did, because she was yelling about how dare the pharmacy tell her how and when to take her medications.

My brother and I retreated to the makeup aisle and laughed like idiots.~~Sorry too hear about your mother. I almost would have told her about that like ""ma'am,  I very much understand you're frustrated about your vaginal cream not being available until the doctor signs off, but my mother actually just had a double mastectomy because of cancer, and while a yeast infection is no laughing matter, wishing my family dies isn't going to expedite this process, and I would appreciate it if we can just move forward to get your cheese-be-gone as quickly possible you dreadful bitch.""

Or whatever. Either way, people that say these things over something so minor usually live miserable lives because small inconveniences send them over the edge. That's a terrible way to live, and hey karma will come back to her, trust me.~~I had a patient ask me SIX TIMES to do a rapid COVID test via zoom. Even if we COULD do that, which we absolutely can not, her airline would not accept that as a valid result. I would explain that to her, she would voice understanding, and then slightly rephrase the question when immediately asking again. POOR PLANNING ON YOUR PART DOES NOT CREATE AN EMERGENCY ON MINE.~~So much this. I work in a call center for a very large private clinic with multiple specialty departments. This has been the majority of my calls for the past week or so. It's worse with specialty since certain departments tend to book out several months in advance and people get so mad when I can't get them in immediately. I've gotten so many ""let me speak to the department manager to complain about access"" calls.

Oh, that and wanting prescription refills immediately, especially controlled substances. Sorry, Karen, I don't think the department is going to refill your oxycontin 2 hours before Christmas.~~Sounds like this woman I was speaking with the other day. I open my call and she flips the fuck out. ""Why can't any of you speak Englush. I can't understand your accent. Speak English. Get me to someone who speaks English in the US."" Granted, she has the thickest accent and can barely speak English herself. I, myself, have little to no accent given the area I'm from and English is my first and only language. I get firm with her and say, ""Ma'am I am speaking English and I am in so and so state in the US.""  I hate people like this and especially even more so the people that ask if I'm ""white."" Just like your story, just goes to show you that you can't help someone that won't help themselves.~~When I worked in a call center, we had an agent who sold our product who was awful to us and convinced we were incompetent. He would call in repeatedly and hang up on people until he got someone he hadn't burned bridges with. He really quickly got to the point where he couldn't find anyone to talk to.~~I work at an insurance call center too and We dont handle that stuff. All of our files are updating through the groups HRs. If someone died, has a baby, got married, divorced, they have to notify their employer and they send over their information. If we did this, it would probably cut our calls in half! So many people call asking to do your encounter or add someone to their policy and get super pissy when we cant.~~Obligatory story about working national reservations for a hotel chain:

Cx: Bob.

Me: Excuse me, are you trying to reach an employee or guest?

Cx: Guest, he is in room 203.

Me: Sir, you called the national reservations hotline, do you know which hotel he is staying in so I can direct your call?

Cx: LA.

*Me internally: Fuck.*

Me: There are over twenty hotels that we own in the area. Can you be more specific?

Cx: No, can't you just look him up? God, you guys are so unhelpful and useless. He doesn't have a phone so he has to use yours and you can't even find him. *click.~~Thats like my region, I have no appointments in DER or  ENDO until June... do not call me and throw a fit that I cant get you in for your yearly routine follow up tomorrow... you have this appointment every year and its ALWAYS like this so why are you acting surprised??~~I get this call at least once a week. We don't (can't) do overrides for refill too soon for most things anyway. I'm not breaking the law for you, and losing my job, sorry. I had a lady who called one time and tried to convince me that another rep was on the phone with her, doing the override, when the call got disconnected, and could I just go ahead and get it done for her. Nope. And if another rep *was* doing the override for her (which I doubt) then that disconnection just saved his job.~~This probably won't be news to you, but as a non-American every time I read a story like this I think ""holy shit that healthcare system is *fucked*"". It's just beyond imagining to me that the elderly and vulnerable who most need reliable and affordable healthcare are forced to navigate this total minefield. Even if you're the sort of person who thinks universal free at point of service healthcare is dangerous communism you still have to think the US system is insane, surely?~~&gt;I probably should have been the bigger person and refunded her

No, you shouldn't have. You absolutely did the right thing. That lousy bitch got exactly what she deserved. :)

I'm the same way=I will go out of my way to help a customer if I can, but if they have abused one of my agents, I will do the bare minimum that I am required to do so as not to be reprimanded for ""Refusing to help a customer"". ~~I would have refused to give them the early appointment.  If they cannot guarantee that they will stay the necessary time for the install, then they don't get the install.

You really shouldn't have tried to accommodate that customer, she was making extremely unreasonable demands.  She is an idiot and caused the whole problem with her stupidity.~~This is when you eli5... You paid in full for X, then you changed your policy and bought Y. X costs this much a year, Y costs this much. You had to pay $ more because you added Y.

""But my deductible is met so I shouldn't have a bill""... OMFG!~~Give him a little credit. He yelled at you instead of the people with the knowledge that could be used to poison him to death, which they will hopefully do sometime in the near future... because youre smart enough to give the pharmacy manager a clue about his behavior, right?~~I once had a cashier ask my name and I said, Sarah with an H. Her response was something l like... wow Ive never heard of it that way before! I was confused since Sarah and Sara are both pretty common. She ended up spelling it something like Shara or Hsara. I dont remember exactly.~~","The commenter works in a pharmacy and finds it difficult to communicate with customers who don't listen to voicemails.

4.0,"I worked as customer service for a home alarm system.  It was constantly like this.

We just know a door opened and someone didn't put in the code after a minute.  That's all we know.  Don't call me because you think you forgot to set your alarm and now think someone is in the goddamn house.  Call the police, you idiot.~~Oh man, I work with health insurance claims agents all day and I try and be as slow, clear, and nice as possible. Because I know there are people out there like this. I used to deal with this and now that I'm on the other side, I try my best to be the ideal customer.~~My grandmother still does this to her middle daughter, who is currently about 66 and suffering from dementia. She is adamant that 'being her mum' entitles her to access to her daughter's medical and financial records, despite the fact that the poor daughter tried desperately to set up mechanisms to keep her away from such information throughout her life. 

I don't think it's remotely uncommon, either: my friend is a social care lawyer and says about 50% of his cases seem to boil down to parents not understanding that their adult child is recognised as having some decision-making rights wherever possible.

I really think we need to start teaching some basic social concepts in schools. Things like consent and capacity are stuff we all come up against throughout our lives, yet SO many people make incorrect assumptions about them.~~The sheer amount of people contacting our call center and are happy and willing to give out their full name, billing and shipping address, and full credit card details but refusing to give us their email address so we can email their receipt/tracking info is astounding. I am always shocked by these folks. For heavens sake, just create a separate email for online purchases people!! These same people will call back and bitch because they dont know when their package will arrive. Grr!~~In my auto days I'd hear ""I already met my deductible this year"" and then be forced to explain that auto is per occurrence while their health is per year. 

In my health insurance days, I'm somehow still stunned when people do not grasp the difference between deductible, copayments, and coinsurance. 

My favorite, which makes me feel rage, is ""I pay you so much every month/year, why should I have to pay more?""  Doesn't matter if it's about the deductible or their renewal rate. People *do not understand* insurance at all.~~I also work in medical claims but I actually work professional to professional. I still managed to get some woman who works claims at a hospital and understands HIPAA to complain that I needed a name and a social or DOB to provide information on a patient. 

She demanded to talk to a supervisor. We laughed before I transferred the call.~~i worked for several years in a callcenter and from my experience doctors are one of those callers that are hard to deal with because they need much more time than the average caller. Many of them acted very arrogant, wanted everything solved immediately although they didnt pay any more than other customers.~~I work for insurance retentions at an inbound call centre and when it's busy I feel this most of the time. ""It took me 45 minutes to get through!"" It must feel so great to be so selfish to think that out of everybody in the entire country you're the only person insured with our company, sir.~~And this is just another reason why the rest of the world thinks the USA is cooked. 

I'm on team customer here. Just reread your own post again. If after reflecting on this you believe that yep that is a totally fair and reasonable thing to do, you'd have just proven my point that the USA is cooked. 

Thank fuck for Medicare and the Australian health system.~~That makes as much sense as the dude mad at my spouse for not using my handicap placard to park in a handicapped spot (hence getting the close spot the guy was after cause hubs legit got their first). He yelled at him for not parking in handicap, hubs responded that it's not his placard so would be illegal to use. Guy replied something about Hubs looking healthy &amp; Trump will soon punish fakers like him?!?!? ~~I work for a medical device company and it is amazing that people get upset when I cannot proceed because they fail HIPAA verification. 

I will get calls from random secretaries who want to place orders for their bosses who are just too busy and too important to call themselves (although I talk to people from every socioeconomic level every day) and the secretaries seem to think it is on me to accommodate them although I am just following the law. I love hearing about how their boss will be extremely displeased when they hear I wouldnt take an order or provide information to them. Lol- if the boss is too busy to call you think they are going to search for a new medical device? Sorry, just wanted to keep my job. 

Edit: all I need is for a boss to call in and add them to their HIPAA approved list but often they need the order  ASAP and cant be bothered. ~~Lol.  Work in a medical facility and had a very similar situation today.  A woman comes to check in her daughter for her Dr appt.  I ask for her birthday and last name. She glares at me, huffs and gives me the month/day (not the year)and her daughters first name only.  I tell her I need the year and the last name to verify her identity.  She starts in about how she comes here all the time and has to answer the same questions every time. 
 Yep, we're just totally unreasonable and like to verify who our patients are before checking them in for a Dr appt and given medications.  ~~Long time phone jockey here (10+ years in multiple industries), I can tell you that no one EVER listens to what you say when they call in
They all expect that you are a mind-reader and will either magically be who they want or able to guess where they want to go.

Its a tough life. The few people that actually listen are fantastic though.~~I can relate 100%. I complained so much that they pulled phone records. In 6 weeks, the top 3 employees took around 700 -800 calls each. One woman took 45 calls in that same time frame. We received a mass email stating this would impact our raises-promotions. Guess who was recently promoted?? Well, I was too, but Ms. 45calls who stays on Pinterest and plans beach vacations on the clock was promoted along with everyone who was in line for one. Hard word doesn't have its own rewards if you work in state government. ~~I work in Australian health insurance, we have very strong public system and a private system for the bigshot doctors. We also force our bigshots to do a bit of public work, because well you know, the hippocratic oath, and they can't get paid 30K each time that'd be a bit silly.

Americans you need to push, push for correct and humanitarian healthcare, it's hard to pay the best of the best what they're worth, but other countries manage it and have ''broken'' but very functional systems.

There's no good reason for a country as rich and prosperous of yours to not have  baseline healthcare system for everyone and then deal  with the anomalies (S tier doctors and rare medical shit) as it comes up.~~It was definitely some kind of scam.   There's no way that people investigating her husband's murder are having the grieving widow do the investigating.  Also, if they haven't been able to ID his body, how do they know that he's been murdered?  If they need the information, they can go through the proper channels.  

You definitely protected patient information.  Privacy laws exist for a reason.~~My mother in law was taken in by a less than honest insurance dealer when she went to sign up for medicare stuff. She ended up w a monthly bill of over $600! I told her there are better ways than to go through her car insurance agent but she trusts the guy. I just smh abt it. 

You sound like a great person OP. Glad the little old lady didn't get taken advantage of.~~I work for an auto loan company. I had to call out on an account that was 80ish days past due. The guy never answered, always his mom. FDCPA states that there cant even be a whiff of possibly talking about a debt or inferring someone has a debt with us unless they are on the loan or added as an authorized 3rd party. Mom is none of these things. I explain i cannot discuss why im calling but to please have so-and-so call us back. She goes into this speil about how she knows we're the auto loan company and we're ruining her sons credit and we need to give him a break because hes young and still doesnt understand how these things work. After finally getting her off the phone, i realize the guy is in his mid-40s. I'll never understand people who have to have their parents handle their finances that late into life.~~i work for the benefits system in the uk i get at least 2-3 a week where i have to do this, most of it is to get us to try do more for them but some of them really are serious.   


had one not long ago that phone in for money, advised them they couldn't have it and that they would need to seek other support, they then told me they were currently getting drugs from their friend and were going to take them all and OD then put the phone down. had to get a welfare officer to check on them. they came back to me and told me they got through and was told they said that as a lie.  


its a joke really they should think of what they are saying because in our case it doesn't help them but is detrimental.~~I had a lady like this once - she gave me her email address in a similar manner. I repeated back ""so that was blahblahblahblah p as in Paul, i as in igloo, n as in Nancy?"" Since that's what I interpreted her mumbling as. 

""NO! TEN LIKE THE NUMBER 10! ONE ZERO! ARE YOU STUPID?""  

Good god. ~~I work for a health insurance company too!  People get so angry about address changes. No, I can't just push a button. My system does not allow address changes unless they come from the employer.  Sure, I can update it and save it, but tomorrow when we get a new electronic eligibility file/coded screams from the depths of hell, it will overwrite it because you haven't updated it with the employer. Contacting the employer isn't a policy as much as a requirement of the system.  

I am a supervisor and I love when people say ""I've spent 20 minutes on the phone already so you could just tell me it can't be done?!"" Yes.  Yes you have, because you wouldn't listen to the rep who told you that in the first place. ~~","The commenter used to work as a customer service representative for a home alarm system and had to deal with customers who didn't put in the code after a minute.

4.0,"How old was this lady? My grandmother is 96. When we moved her closer to my mom, she thought she had to physically take her money out of her old branch to move it to the new one. Mind blown when we explained her money was sort of in the air and could be transferred electronically and so on.

She also thinks people can watch her through her tv so she covers it up. It doesn't have a camera and she doesn't have internet. 

Think of all the changes old people like that have gone through. My grandmother was born in the 1920s. She's almost as old as the Titanic. Be patient with them. My grandmother is a sweet little old lady who used to teach Sunday school. When she calls up a business (and admittedly drives them up the wall with her inability to understand the modern world) I hate to think they're going on Reddit calling her a dumb bitch.~~Last time I had to go to the pharmacy I had the time wrong and watched the gate (it is a pharmacy located inside of a store) going down when I was ten feet from it. I was annoyed but only at myself for getting the time wrong. I left and came back the next day. I was not going to yell or force them to give me the prescription. Some people are idiots.~~I feel your pain.  

Years ago, I worked for a pharmacy benefits manager.  Used to get calls all the time complaining about copay increases.  

""That god damned George Bush raised my copays again!""  

""Yes sir, the President called me personally and said to raise Mr. Dimwit's copays and blame his plan for their poor investment strategery.""  ~~Serious question, how do medical appointments get booked up so absurdly far in advance? I imagine its gotta be a supply-demand thing where the number of available doctors/dentists cant match the number of people needing care, but needing to go several months out doesnt seem to happen with other appointment industries like salons/barbershops or mechanics.~~It's (usually) not that they don't understand, more that they don't like the answer. I took escalations for two different companies, AT&amp;T and Apple, and when the custoker didn't like a response they would try to escalate past me or Just call back around 35% of the time. It could even have been more, but with the contact routing to another location.

The reason they do it is that they think it will work. And occasionally it might, who knows? I'm sure we all have one friend who managed to get to a C Level executive at some company and got free stuff. So statistically it sometimes works, it's just rare and getting rarer as companies learn how to control contacts better.~~Honestly I think of mask wearing the same way I think of a stores policy of No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service. I feel like thats how I would try to explain it to customers. But Ive dealt with *her* kind before. Its either hit or miss with those ones. Smh.~~Dollars to donuts, the doctor never told her they would call her back. Patients put words in doctor/receptionist/nurse/techs mouths all the time to try to get what they want, or they hear only what they *want* to hear. There was no reason to call her back. She wants to be a simpering idiot that gets pleasure from wasting everyones time-thats on her.~~I also work with gov benefits on the banking side, we only handle accounts receiving gov benefits or subsidies, I work mainly w retired, disabled, or VA recipients. I genuinely do understand how low some of these people feel, I get it and absolutely no judgement. I also hear things like this a lot too. While 99% might just be saying it for a reaction I feel like its just a good rule to report them all, you just never know.~~Dude lmfao. I had some prick try and strong arm me like this once. He had been a customer( a shitty and rude one at that) and called my boss at like 530 as he has been gone for the day. He tells me theyre close friends and NEEDED my boss to help him N O W!!!

Kind of like the self defense course I took once. The instructor handed us all a radish, and told us to pop it, if we could, between our thumb and index finger. She said that was almost exactly the same amount of pressure it took to pop a male testicle. I've never forgotten that. ~~I guess he could have that whole conversation without personally identifiable information. (e.g. What is your generic policy for what patients should bring to a sleep study?)

What's weird though, is that he's totally okay with giving his medical record number, and he doesn't argue about whether or not you need to identify him to answer the question, but instead gets argumentative about how you identify him.~~Are the records you can access able to show if these 40+ boys have any mental or physical disabilities? If not I could imagine a few of these calls being from their parents, who are active as care takers, trying to sort their sons appointments out and there is no way to discern wether its true or not. ~~&gt; I give up trying and just put down what I heard, whether its right or not isnt my problem.

This. I've given up trying or asking them to repeat themselves for the third time. In between the shitty cell phone connection and people like this, it's a wonder anything is correct.~~Ive said it before and Ill say it againcustomers like those are why I love my job. They are few and far between but when you get one you work as hard as you can to assist them and you do whatever you can to help them. And its good when your efforts dont go unnoticed. Good for you! Keep up the good work!~~We've been getting it from all angles, too. Oh, you waited until 2 days before Christmas to request a prescription refill and you only have 5 days left of your medication? GO TO THE LOCAL PHARMACY. If we place a mail order refill at this time, you will NOT receive it before you run out, even if you pay for expedited shipping.~~OMG I got a similar situation where her husband of 60 years passed a few months ago, and on after call started crying bc it made me think of my fianc, etc. I tend to think those calls are so much worse than getting screamed at...I can tune out your anger, but I most certainly cannot tune out your sadness. :(~~Was this caller with work comp, by chance? Because HIPAA doesn't apply to state work comp statutes, and (subjectively) 30 days can be agonizingly long for comp adjusters - pressures from employers, injured workers (its basically short-term disability plus medical insurance), and state comp divisions, doctors requesting auth for treatments, ambulance-chasing lawyers threatening petitions at any delay).

Regardless, she sounds idiotic. Excuses aside (if they even apply), I'm sorry your coworker had to deal with this dope...~~As a whole, our agency has a lot of *really* stupid, counter-productive procedures in place.  These procedures cause a multitude of delays which generate an increase in calls from angry customers.  Of course, it's the phone reps who have to bear the brunt of disgruntled customers.  

I routinely placate the customers by *agreeing* with them about how bad these procedures are, how this is no way to run a business, how terrible we are, etc.  If it's been a particularly bad day, I even tell them how these procedures are the bane of my employment and how I can't wait to find another job (so I don't have to listen to the constant bitching but I leave this part out).  I don't know if it makes them feel like I'm on their side, but it helps stop them from venting their frustrations out on me directly.  ~~Oh god, the ""You gave me the wrong number, this one just goes to voicemail"" response.

Take a deep breath, contemplate your life at that moment, go to bed, and call in the morning. Customer service is not a magic wand that fixes your problems at the precise moment you want.~~At first I thought ""well ok, but I mean, it sucks ass when insurance changes the covered medications on you and you go to fill a prescription and the pharmacist tells you it'll be $350 now."" then I read it was a fucking vitamin, how do you get escalated about a $5 vitamin?~~My boss (~60) has been in tremendous pain for months. When he called in and asked if he could move his yearly physical up a few months, the nurse told him repeatedly she couldn't do that. She never offered to just schedule another, completely separate appointment for him.

Fast forward a month to today, it turns out he has prostate cancer, and the doctors should have caught it _two years_ ago. It's probably spread to his bones and his liver, but since his liver is failing, it's not safe to do a scan to check. If a man needs an appointment, please get him an appointment.~~I work for an Optomerist and deal with this on a daily basis. I like when they come in person and try to act like they know the doctor and he shuts them down pretty quickly with, Whats your name? and continues to look up their chart and they havent been seen in like 3 years. Ughhhh.~~I work in a bank call center and took over one of my agents calls last night as this customer had been arguing about a stop payment disclosure for 20 minutes. This customer was also going to have to call back in the future to remove the stop payment.  Trying to be helpful since she was so difficult for both the frontline rep and my escalation rep I offered her by direct dial number and mentioned I work Tuesday through Saturday 330 to midnight. 

She was upset that I would not be available 24/7 to her. She finally said after I had spent 20 minutes more with her she wanted to make some calls before calling back to place the stop. So she wanted my direct number.

I told her at this point you can dial and provided the general customer service number. I could care less if your IRS payment was stopped. (No I didn't say that last part) but some people take pleasure in making every interaction difficult.~~","The commenter empathizes with a 96-year-old woman who thinks she has to physically take her money out of her old bank account to move it to a new one.

Yeah, again, notta gonna happena.  here is the website, knock yourself out.~~Oh the call back system, ours is similar to your automatic call system.

It's too bad that you couldn't have someone without a mask go in and sit with that lady who wouldn't wear a mask, and before being seen by the doctor, tell her, ""Oh, by the way, I have COVID, but thankfully it's my Constitutional right to not wear a mask."" THAT would make her shit a brick.~~Kinda related. I tried to make a phone call back to someone I had just spoken to over the phone while at work, and I heard it ring and then started talking after the person said hello. Heard a weird echo of myself which was weird, never had this. Went on for 30 seconds before I realized I didn't hit call but I hit ""play"" on the software being used for the phone we had. 

I was talking to a recording of the recent call I had instead of a live call.

But that's funny someone got a robot call and thought they were being talked over. Like, sometimes its an actual recorded voice someone did for a reminder.~~Look, these closures and lockdowns suck ass. We all want to do the things we used to do, especially at holiday time, especially with people we may not get the chance to see ever again.

But the risks are just too great. Not even just from Covid, but the trickle down effects. Had a heart attack and need an ICU bed? Sorry, they're full with Covid patients. Been in a car wreck and need top notch care? Sorry, everyone's burnt out and quitting en masse.

We said we had to speak to his wife, the account holder, and he ""passed the phone over to her"" which involved him putting on a super fake sounding high pitch voice pretending to be her. He could answer all the DPA questions, but obviously, the advisor wasn't budging, and started trying to trip him up-sometimes, he'd put on the ""wife"" voice when it should have been him, sometimes he'd change mid-sentance from ""wife"" to normal. Eventually we said we'd need to call both him and his wife as you did, and mysteriously the call dropped. It was by far the best 5 minutes of training.

Of course the supervisor is in a different call center states away, certainly sir I'm placing you on hold till they get here it will be about 6 hours.~~I know how you feel. I work in a related industry, and the amount of times customers ask how much to fix a random noise they've heard before I've had a chance to ask for their name. Then they get upset because I need to take some basic info, such as their name and the car details. Oh, and don't forget their attitude or belief that they are our only customer...~~The more I read stories like this the more I appreciate the companies that have a rule that at the first instance of threatening legal action the call ends with a statement to the customer that all further communication must be through the company's legal department.

It quickly weeds out those who think they can threaten their way to what they want...

...and it lessons the amount of abuse the call center employees have to deal with.~~The number of people who don't know the very basics for things like car ownership is crazy. I seriously knew someone who thought you just stopped by the gas station once a week, and they gave you enough gas to last until you came in next week, no matter how much you drove. She told me this when I had just driven 20 miles out of town to the middle of nowhere with a gas can to help her........~~I'm a boomer.  I grew up with computers.  I have lost count of how many computers I've built from scratch.

My high school classmates are boomers.  About half of them have decent computer skills.

The other half of my class would never have learned to use a mouse except for Microsoft Solitaire and Minesweeper.

And for a couple, even that is out of their grasp.~~They rarely follow through. Sometimes they're just mad and sometimes (Like here) they're just ridiculously irrational.

I used to work for a cable company once upon a time and there would be people that would call at 10-11PM and demand a tech be out there within half an hour. I had to calmly tell them that the only available openings were a few days out.~~Many years ago, I worked at a pizza place in a mostly-white area.  We would get the occasional ""that's racist"" from black customers who were slightly outside of our delivery area.

One in particular has always stuck with me.  She was livid and was determined to get some satisfaction about how our manager (Tracy) was treating her.  SO RACIST not to deliver to her!  She must have pictured Tracy as a snotty trust fund white girl, which honestly she kind of sounded like.

The customer came to the store to give Tracy a piece of her mind, but stopped dead in her tracks when she saw that Tracy was also black.  Considerably moreso than the customer, in fact.  She didn't have anything smartass to say after that.

When she walked out the door defeated, I got the impression that Tracy had never in her life been so happy to be black.  She got to put someone in their place free of charge.~~I answer for a number of towing companies where I work and that sounds like a ton of the retail customers we get calling in. Most of them happen to be people calling in about offroad recoveries and shit, and than complain when we cant get a truck out to them cause they're 23km on a logging road that hasn't been driven on in 5 years and half buried in mud and snow. 

Yeah no shit we dont wanna send a truck up there, we dont even know how the fuck you got up there that far.~~She literally could not wrap her head around the concept that you did not have the exact means to meet her request at that exact moment which would require her to be patient.  She is so confused because of how entitled she is: she simply believes that being a customer means the thing she wants is always there and she just has to ask for it.~~","The commenter had a similar experience with a customer who was trying to add their car to their wife's policy, but the advisor wouldn't allow them to speak to the customer's wife. The commenter believes that the customer's behavior was unacceptable and that the advisor should be held accountable"
5.0,"I can attest when you are nice they help.

Had my car towed home as it was late/weekend and an older car that may go to any number of shops depending on the issue.  Also no places open/smaller suburb.

Come Monday I had determined what needed to be done and where to go - now open.

Heard/knew the no retow rule but very nice person made the exception for the above reasons.

Always be nice to those that are helping you. And NEVER send your food back to the kitchen.~~I bet if there were 6 month memberships people would set it up so its only during the winter. 

Also, this reminds me of how my 100 year old great grandma was pissed that she had to pay her water bill at her house still when she moved to the nursing home. It was a few dollars. ~~I worked in the auto industry for years everything from domestics to Rolls.  My favorite people were the particular ones you are referring to. They especially didnt like the cute, girl next door type to point out their mistakes. I had a lot of fun when they would be rude and try to mansplain to me.  It was always refreshing to put them in their place.~~Several years ago, a young and naive Xeno would have thought 'she can't possibly have expected this to work' but today, and older and wiser Xeno knows she did expect it to work and didn't realize that changing her story in call was not the best of plans. You gotta love idiots who ruin their own plans.~~BUT HE TOOK A VAAAAAAAN! Is that too hard to understand? The VAAAAN is clearly larger than a vehicle, which he didn't take. Because he took a VAAAAAN!

Having a brainfart is one thing, happens to the best of us. But insisting and complaining is the one thing I actually hate. Like, dude, take a breather and let's get this thing taken care of. Chill.

Is there a ""do not rent"" list like in other types of business? Please put this person on there.~~Sorry you had to endure that man, dont worry that caller will step on lego... Not just one but a lot!

Still, they should be more civil when talking to you guys. After all... They are asking YOU for help and their vulnerable ass is stuck wherever the hell they are, good for them i'd say hehe.~~Umm, Im real curious how she thinks anyone could have papers carry around saying they dont have Covid unless theyre consistently getting tested what, every day? Every hour? After every contact with another human being? Who on earth thinks that is even remotely reasonable? I have a feeling shes gonna be waiting a looooooooong time for a tow!~~Lol.  Also work at said or similar propane company.  Had a woman make the tech return a 120 gal tank THAT SHE WANTED INSTALLED because I dont want that ugly thing in my yard.  Then basically said she wanted a few grill tank sized cylinders instead.   God forbid people see a propane tank in your yard and think that you heat your house.~~But lots of people/places DO offer priority service for frontline medical staff and emergency workers.

A doctor IS more important to get to their appointments than the guy who makes my burgers. Or ME on my way to visit friends.

How in the hell can you think a doctor is not a higher priority roadside assistance customer than someone working at Mcdonalds?~~*Calls at 2 minutes before close* Hi I have a thing on my wall.. a. A.. 
*proceeds to butcher company name 5 times as a kid is screaming Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. The entire  call.* 
Do people not teach thier kids phone etiquette anymore? Jesus. And of course they have zero info. I have to painfully tell them what Im looking for despite the recording telling her many times before she got to me to have her numbers ready.

I absolutely hate people who call when they drive. I dont want to hear them getting into an accident because they cant take 5 mins to pay attention to the call thier on and are trying to read numbers off thier phone.

I feel you. Im glad I am not beholden to a bus schedule anymore.~~He heard what he wanted to hear not what you told him. Don't take it personally he probably would have done it to anyone else because the resolution is the same. If It were me I'd get his name and if possible email his boss and be like yea teach this fuckwit to respect other employees who are trying to help.~~They told me that it was a security issue when I needed a tow that I couldn't get a ride. Not only was I in a rural area with bad cell reception,  but that was actually the last call that cell phone ever made. 

I was still polite and understood that it is company policy. Luckily the tow driver was a kid I went to high school with and had to drive past my house to get back to work.~~LOL reminds me of a convo i had with my best , beloved Uncle. I love that man dearly. He was working with a saw in my back yard one day and cut the tip off his finger. Came in and asked me for a towel. I asked what kind he needed, and he said - oh i cut the end off my finger. I just need a towel and a bandaid. 

Me- you need an ambulance.

Uncle- No , just a bandaid I will be fine. 

Me- you need to SIT right here, while i call 911 (called)

Medics arrive- Ya you need to go to the city hospital

Uncle-  small town ER is ok i just need a bandaid

EMT- nope thats gonna need surgery, city for you!

Uncle- you sure a bandaid wont work?~~People who are not cooperating with the agent just annoys me. Had a customer on presale of a product, and he said he purchased it but every time he did hed get something in German. I asked him to put it in google translate and all I got was that he couldnt be bothered. Then why call? Youre wasting not only my time but your own time as well, or is it just me?~~I found out one of my customers was super racist, like Anti-Black. 
Incredibly awkward, so I upped the ante and told him my Great Aunt was 100% African American. 
(We have a family photo 100% real, I keep one on my phone for these occasions). 

So right after I say that, Im thinking (BOOM BITCH, pick up that MIC OLD MAN!)
Naw he looks me dead in the face and he says I am so terribly sorry, that kind of strain on the family

Some people arent racist man they are just plain ignorant.~~that is absolutely ridiculous. they just messed up his arm for life. i hope the police catch them as expediently as possible. hit &amp; run is a felony offense, correct? i think that would be grounds for account deactivation

im glad to hear that the driver is doing alright. hopefully he has a good recovery and can resume some normalcy in his life~~I work for a breakdown company also, no longer front line but your description of what its like during peak periods is almost identical to what we go through which is funny since were in different countries.

My worst call was not long after I started, still constantly stressed out (since we are technically an emergency service although it sounds silly to say) and unsure of processes etc. A woman phones through with a flat battery, I think yes heres an easy one I know how to deal with it, then when I ask her her location she just breaks down in tears absolutely inconsolable. She kept trying to pull it together and speak but it just wasnt happening. Eventually someone took over the call, turns out it was a police officer and the poor woman was phoning because she broke down outside her sons house just after discovering that he had committed suicide. That was a rough day~~Back in the day phones were best for this, the heavy plastic could take the most rage-fueled receiver slam you could manage, and the design was such that you didn't slam your fingers! Sooo satisfying!
And if they pissed you off enough, you pick the phone back up and yell ""and fuck you too""!! Then get that sweet sweet double slam...mmmm that was good~~I had a similar call once, a wife wanted to use her husband's card on her account and that's a no go for security reasons. I said I'd need his authorization and she said he's off on a business trip. I advise her I can't place the order with his card without his authorization but I'd be happy to use one of her cards on file. She said oh hold on... Then came back a few seconds later with a deep voice. I said ma'am I know that's you... And she cursed and hung up ~~&gt; I just hung up the phone without another word. (My boss has no problem with us doing that when people start getting abusive.) About 2 minutes later, the phone rings again.

Yeah I hate how a lot of call centers have a ""no hang up no matter what"" policy. I work in a call center and that's one rule I don't listen to. Customer on the line is abusive to me I hang up and close their ticket.

I don't do it often but sometimes the customer deserves to be hung up on.~~Someone who was actually a friend of the VP wouldn't argue at all...she'd just end the call however it ended, and then text/call the VP and say ""WTF is with your agents?""  

The benefit of actually knowing a senior manager is that he/she can fix things for you, if necessary. 

(And I am not at all implying you did anything wrong--just that in my experience, people who say they know owners/senior management rarely actually do, whereas people who really do, never tell you.)~~I have dealt with this sort of thing in several call centers and it always comes down to PPM(Protective Parent Mode). It doesn't matter if their child is an adult, lives on their own, or is married with three kids and successful in finances. They fear that by giving you information about their child over the phone they endanger them, and often times the information that must be protected does not make sense. When dealing with a parent like this there is nothing you can do to alleviate the situation because no matter how sane and rational your explanation is it cannot over rule PPM.~~I give out an email address all the time that I use phonetic information for; O as in Oscar, D as in David, S as in Sally, C as in Charlie, P as in Peter.

When people repeat it back to me they'll say F as in Fan and B as in Ball.  I purposely choose names that are obviously not easy to confuse with other letters, and not only do they get the letter wrong, but they repeat it back in a way that is vague enough to not know if they have it correct or not.  S/F with Sam/Fan, P/B with Paul/Ball.  If you're going to phonetically spell something make sure that the words you choose aren't ones that sound similar to words that start with a sound-alike letter.~~",The commenter had a car towed home due to a late night and an older car that may go to any number of shops depending on the issue. The person on the other end of the line was rude and didn't want the commenter's food back. The commenter had a negative experience with

The Uncle seemed to think that filing a report would cause trouble for his nephew. Requesting a welfare check or filing a missing person's report usually just means the police will try to locate you, verify that you don't need help, and then leave. 

If the nephew had had a car accident or something like that, it would have meant someone was looking for him sooner, and possibly can get help faster.~~You're not alone! Just today (I work with thermostat support)...

Caller: Yes, why did my heat come on?

Me, after checking account: Well sir, I see you have it in heat mode. Is that how you set it?

Caller: Yeah, I want it in heat mode, I set it for 78.

Me: Okay, well that's why your heat came on. It's set for 78 and it dropped to 76, then the heat kicked on to warm it back up to 78 like it should when in heat mode.

Caller: Oh.. 

Like wtf... And that's just one example. I try to remember that our customers aren't trained on every aspect of our equipment and services like I am, but sometimes the questions are so stupid I swear people are messing with me. I'm sorry, I know it's frustrating!~~We have one who calls constantly pulling the but I am a DOCTOR!!!!!! card. Hes so annoyingly pretentious that someone anonymously added a note on his account pointing out dr of philosophy- not real dr!! 

Yeah buddy, let me push all these tickets to one side, so that you can get back online and continue your essential work of debating beauty versus morality.~~I wonder what happened to people like this to make them so rude and entitled. Idk why they think talking so abusively is gonna get them what they want. I hope that ass misses his bus. That's lucky that was your last call so at least you could leave right after. And fuck the government for forcing employees to tolerate abusive behavior like this. You should be allowed to warn them and hang up if they continue.~~WTF? I can understand some of the other issues being a communication problem, but this? If he had some sort of onboard GPS that you could track, maybe call for a location, but ...I am shaking my head.

My second thoughts were ""I'm sorry sir, we do software support, and you need new hardware.""~~I would say sounds like AAA but area I work is opposite, they care more bout the employees then. Okey, I was assaulted by a member for refusing a jump start due to being drunk, AAA canceled membership and supplies police with Info so they could locate and track them down~~Got out of the game last year and it feels good.

I now have a job Where I truly enjoy working there and it's stress free.

Call centers are a meat grinder and all the people who used to work with me have either quit or got fired due to some bullshit reason and the very few got promoted to a better position. ~~Can you call MY daughter?    She was getting $5.00 parking tickets at college and unknown to me, she got my license suspended for unpaid fines.    I was lucky that the Lt. that ran me knew me and figured out what the problem was. 

I got a hold of her and had her take care of it while she was at school.  Then I took my car off her so she couldn't do it again.  Gave her a car from my company that would not come back to hurt my license.   Had her register the tag with campus PD.

She was arrested later in the year and her grandpa went and bailed her out, but I still found out.~~Many years ago I drive a tow truck. Some of the most uncomfortable moments were when I had to tow a car with 5 passengers and Im stuck explaining to a broke mom that they will have to call a cab for her and her kids or something...  Im really sorry but I cannot let your kids sit in the car while I tow it...~~Gotta watch out for those concrete columns, they just jump right out into traffic without looking.


But seriously, as we age lots of things happen to our brains, reaction times and eyesight.   It gets easier to get confused and even lose any situational awareness in new places.

You might be fine driving in your own town and city, but that is habit and memory replacing degrading skills and mental.processing.

And one of the cruelest parts of this, is that often those in the early stages of this are aware that they are losing things and are frustrated or scared by it.

It does not excuse spreading those reactions to people around you but in many states in the U.S. there is not a good process for managing and identifying this.~~Lol the bolt will keep hurting the tyre. 

Honestly I dont think hes insane, just extremely stupid. 

But anyway may this be a lesson to all - this applies to stab wounds too. Do not pull out the knife if you get stabbed. Leave it in and go to the ER. 

The knife/whatever punctured you doesnt keep hurting your body. You need to remove it carefully under medical supervision at the ER to prevent further damage when pulling out. ~~Okay if the bus is early or late, she can complain about it. But she sprained her ankle while running behind the bus is the funniest thing ever. 

And she is asking for compensation from the company. She should get a Volini spray and tie her ankle with a crab bandage.~~Wait so if your bus is early (or I'm assuming late) you guys will pay for a taxi? Am I understanding that correctly? 

In the US, they don't care if the bus is late or early. They tell you to always arrive 15minutes early just in case the bus is early. But if you don't and it is, sucks to be you. You're waiting another hour.~~I also work for a 3 letter ERS provider. You guys aren't allowed to hang up on the members? With us they tell us to try to escalate to a supervisor but we have the power to hang up on them. Also you must be in a different coverage area than me because the club I work in, never bans members. Even the member who ran over a drivers arm and then took off never got banned....must be nice.~~I do hotel reservations at a national reservation line.  I got a call from a hotel guest for me to call the night manager because a woman was getting beat up in the parking lot.  I said, ""Wouldn't it be best to just call 9-1-1?""  

I mean, by the time I looked up that property's private cell phone, called it, waited for the guy to answer, if he answered, who knows what could have transpired?~~I had one were they wouldn't give me any information, and kept asking for a manager.  the furniture company I work for isn't huge like 7 states but it's 7 states and we have certain managers that do z,y,x.. 

 Don't ask for a manager without giving me any information.  She finally hung up and I got her 1 days later and she didn't recognize me.  Kept going and gave me the info this time. Like this could have solved yesterday.  ~~Most people do the phonetics with names like J for John

When I asked this person to read the vin I swear they used only deserts.

Uhm, C as in Cake...J as in Jello... it was so painful just sitting there waiting for them to think of words for this unspoken rule they made up.~~I can just imagine,

*""Yes, I can have it sent by mail, why are you saying I can't? I want credit monitoring by mail, it's no different than email, it's just a real mailbox, not an electronic one, why is this so hard for you? ... No, I already talked to customer service on the phone and when I said I was going to come here they said it was okay! They said it was fine... Yes, they said to come into the branch to give you my address... Well, they told me you can, I want to speak to your supervisor so they can help me.""*~~I work for a construction company and customers love to go ""I spent TWO HUNDRED GRAND on this house and the carpet just feels cheap""

Where I live thats like, the absolute minimum you could possibly spend to build a new house. It's an insanely cheap house. Of course you're getting landlord grade carpet.~~I love this tale, but I'm afraid to note that throwing _some_ diesel in a petrol car will maybe not be great for the engine but it will run. Don't go running petrol cars on full diesel, but it should manage up to 50% depending on several factors including luck.~~I get at least 2-3 calls a week like this that want to know info on their cc account but must have some kind of mental aerobics going on in their head because they insist they wanted a different piece of information after I deliver the answer to the first question! 

At the end of the day, I know Im amazing and that some people have critical thinking inadequacies.~~I work ERS as well and I hate when we get doctors or lawyers. However if the doctor mentions that he has to go to work, we are required to make them a priority. Only if they say they have to go to work. However when it's busy qnd we have limits on what services we do, we no longer make them a priority and they're required to wait as well.~~The word ""unacceptable"" just kind of instantly triggers the acid reflux that I didn't have three years ago in a way nothing else can now. What's that, you want an answer that isn't actually possible and that places you somehow above the hundreds of other people that have called today all wanting their non-essential thing RIGHT NOW? No? Unacceptable! ~~I get people trying that with me it's near funny they claim to know the CEO. His office is 20 feet away. We are not a big company by any means. I walk over ask do you know so and so... nope. Come back to the phone call their bluff and that's the end of that.~~I somewhat see why the lady would think the dealer shop can't repair her car according to her need, especially if she has an older/high mileage vehicle not expected to last more than a few more years. However, (1) many dealers will install used parts, with the tradeoff being reduced or no warranty. (2) The time to decide where to have your car towed is before the towing request is completed and the truck is en route. (3) No matter where you take you car, never assume whether you will be getting new/used without first checking with the shop. Again, ideally the time to do this is before driving/towing your vehicle there.~~",The commenter empathizes with the situation described in the post and suggests that filing a missing person's report would have helped if the nephew had been involved in a car accident. They also express frustration with the customer's behavior and suggest that they could have handled the situation better. The commenter also
5.0,"I used to be an OTR trucker, it was always super inconvenient when I needed to replace a windshield. Usually, I could manage to figure out where I'd be taking a 34-hour reset a day or three in advance, and try to get the glass ordered to a mobile shop nearby.

The problem is though, that technically almost any break in my glass qualified as an out-of-service violation, so technically I should have just pulled over and waited until someone local to wherever I was could do it (Not generally feasible, I had delivery commitments...and there are surprisingly large portions of this country where the closest glass shop is 50+ miles away.), and if a cop got a bug up his ass before I did get it fixed, I could wind up in a world of hurt.

Also, this was meant to contextualize the issues buddy here was facing, not excuse him for being a jackass.~~Worked in commercial ""auto"" insurance. Had this quite a few times. I also had ""it's not a vehicle it's a trailer"" which makes a kind of sense. But our definitions were vehicle is anything with wheels, power unit is something that moves under it's own power, trailer is something that doesn't and is pulled.

I also had a guy argue whether or not his plow blade was ""permanently attached equipment"" because he could remove it in half an hour with a socket wrench. We counted anything that wouldn't fall off if a giant picked the vehicle up and flipped it over. In the end, I said ""Look, do you want the blade covered?"" Yeah ""Well we don't cover things that aren't 'permanently attached equipment' so you have to let us *call* it that.""~~I would love to call a center and get this

""Switching you over to special Karen/Kevin customer care, please scream louder so she or he can hear you."" Then switch them to another yelling customer and place bets on how long before they hang up.  LOL. Would make a great humor podcast.~~Just one day in a year we should be allowed to call out morons with no repercussions. 

Just one.

That person the annoying moron wasn't listening.

I normally give a count to ten of silence and explain why I need the information and what it will be used for.  If they tell me it's from some one else I get their name first at least.

The phrase ""At the time of purchase"" helps a lot even with original customers. ~~I am female... And twice I had male customers compare something (charges on a bill for one, a software update that couldn't be avoided for the other) to being raped. The first time I was shocked enough to not say anything but the second time I called the guy out on it. I'd had time to think of how to shut that down without getting in trouble. He at least had the grace to apologize and recant, but I didn't let him get away with that asshattery.

Talk to your boss and see if they have suggestions on how to respond to comments like that. ~~I had a woman flip out and scream at me today because I asked for her name. Literally, that's all I asked for. She screamed that she wanted a manager and that she wasn't giving me her name because there was no reason I needed her name. I refused to transfer her until I got her first name. My manager said she was not a nice woman and went on a rant about millennials being entitled and rude. People are ridiculous.~~Ive encountered the same. Why you talk so white? Really? Because I can properly articulate a sentence? Because I enunciate the words I speak correctly. At work Ive had white people call me the N bomb on the phone and black people tell me they want to speak to their own kind it can be disheartening.~~In my work (IT 2nd) aggressive customers are scarce. Maybe one a month. Insulting customers are also pretty scarce.
We are authorized to hang up. But apparently, I am not authorized to tell them ""do you realize that I can see on screen where you live?""
I soooo would like to. TL told me ""please, don't""~~This reminds me of a call I was on. We get a call, mbr needs a car towed to a shop for repair. Standard shit. We get there. Car has four flats doesnt run and drive has been sitting for a while and has no plates or reg. We immediately question. Heard two different stories (was being scrapped for parts and she just bought it and planned to repair...) Technically we dont tow to junk yards or cars that were just bought. We ask for ID all she had was a debit card.... no way to prove she owned the car, that she was a mbr, that she was who she was. We told her we couldnt tow her at this time she fucking lossssssst it. We actually had to call the cops when she swung at me.... was.... nuts. Best part this was my first week training~~My cousins have had to deal with this type of thing too. They're both black, adopted by a white family when they were just a few months old. The brother is a very polite, well spoken and ambitious young man, his sister sort of saw the bullshit her older brother put up with from their peers from ""not being black enough"" and went in the opposite direction cashing in on every black stereotype. They couldn't be more polar opposites now that they're adults.~~I used to work in membership for an ERS company &amp; we also would place ERS calls rather than transfer. Its actually wild how many drivers wouldnt even ask for ID. I liked the policy at first because I got tired of people lying and pretending to be someone else.. me tell them we cant service them because the member isnt with the vehicle.. only for them to call back pretend to be the member this time, that rep doesnt read the notes that we already know the person is lying, so they put the call through and then the driver goes out &amp; doesnt even ask for ID or the membership card at all anyway. So it would make me look like the AH when I actually was just following protocol.~~All the person has to do is drive new car in, get new ticket.  Drive out old car and clock out with new ticket.  Paying for 15 minutes or whatever the minimum time is. 

They can use the old ticket when they are ready to pay for the X days they have used the parking space upon driving out the second car.

Anything else is a scam or scamola.~~I'm going part time after being full time for four years. I'm finally done with my education, so the first job out of college always pays little (that's why I'm going part time at the CC). I work for a law firm and I hate it when people want to sue for stupid stuff. I'm glad you're moving to a better place.~~I used to work for a third party verification company. Had a lady call in, call was going fine until I read ""I see your address is 1234 bullshit way, somewhere, some state, is this correct?"" Oh man. She lost it so bad, questioned how she knew I was with the company she was buying services from even though I clearly already had her info. Of course I informed her, again, ""we are a third party and as such I absolutely do not work for them. You're welcome to reach out to them directly at the number provided by your agent so they may transfer you back to one of my colleagues"" ~~Around the holidays, I had a week where five or six people said love you! when hanging up. Force of habit, I think...I work for a utility company. We are *not* loved.

Its worse when they say keep me in your prayers because then I feel like Im responsible for praying for them.~~That's kinda like the time my purse was stolen. My phone was in my pocket, so that was safe. I had literally no money in my wallet, not even a few cents change because I spent everything I had on some groceries before my purse was stolen.

I would have LOVED to see the person's face when they realized they got basically nothing!!~~In fairness (and no offense intended, I have good friends in the business), I think people are uniquely suspicious of car dealerships and some of it is well-deserved. 


Doesn't make sense to scream at some poor sap working the phones, but that's one of the few situations where I fully expect a real company to at least attempt to outright scam me. Still though, not the phone guy's fault.~~Had it yesterday, woman calling in to complain that we hadn't collected her car after SHE had arranged it be picked up the day after. Took me half an hour. I've learnt to save one of my two ten minute breaks since then 9 minutes before clock out to stop it happening~~This sounds too familiar, smh. I know people call us for help and they are frustrated and such but there are so many times where they act out of pocket. 

I love the ones that call you and before you can get your greeting out they go on a rant about how you WILL do this and that or else. Like give me a damn break. 

Keep your head up out there. Im so excited to be finally leaving my call center job in a few weeks. Its been 3 years for me and that is honestly enough. Im done.~~I would consider calling the police for a wellfare check. The caller seems an idiot, and not have any emergency at all, but sometimes people get confused during accidents or emergencies or don't want to be a bother, or maybe he's not mentally all there.

I'd tell the non-emergency police that somebody kept claiming they have a medical emergency but when you offer to call 911, suddenly he just wants a towtruck.

Like I said, its likely he doesn't have a medical emergency, but you're not a doctor, so how would you know for sure. I'm guessing police knows he's just an idiot too and only would go if they're not too busy, so it wouldn't hurt anyone.~~Refusing to queue drop was a regular reason I got told off at my old job. 

It wasnt call avoidance like they used to accuse me of, but if someones gone through a query with me, already gotten snotty and then needs to speak to someone else, Im warning the person receiving the call.~~","The commenter used to work in commercial auto insurance and had to deal with customers who didn't understand the difference between a car and a trailer. They also had to deal with customers who didn't understand the difference between a plow blade and a socket wrench, and had to ask for the customer"
5.0,"I had a call on Tuesday with someone trying to do a settlement, and explained why. I told him I was sympathetic to his situation and actually related a similar tale from my own life. I made him an offer, and he immediately asked to speak with my TL.

Okay, whatever, he didn't like my offer and wants to plead his case to management directly.

Nope! Told my TL Id said I was *not* sympathetic to his situation and Im a horrible CSR. Said TL, thankfully, sits kitty corner from me and tells him she could hear me and thats not what I said. Im like 85% sure he said that just to try and get a more favorable settlement offer, to make up for my egregious lack of decorum.

The QC agent told me he was mad for me after he pulled the call.~~My job used to be managing total loss collateral at a bank. The number of people who do what this lady did are fucking baffling.

She didn't buy insurance from the dealership. She bought Gap coverage, and Gap coverage only kicks in if there's an Insurance check, and there's only an insurance check if you have FULL COVERAGE.~~Absolutely not your fault. you didn't put her or the other person behind the wheel. You did your job.

You're showing you are an actual human being by feeling guilty, but she knew the conditions when she went out on the road. Some people just don't listen or try to tough it out. 

It's a damn shame it happened. I know its been almost 15 years, but hopefully you haven't beat yourself up over it.~~The fact that they ran from the scene knowing that you know exactly who they are is so baffling to me. Like, Im sure it was an impulse reaction but you *obviously* have their information since they called your company where theyre a member. If theyd stayed, Im sure there would have been some kind of minor consequence but people would understand it was just an accident. Now its a felony, AND you know exactly where to find them. Jesus Christ.~~My most memorable:

""I believe your version of things. It's just that absent notes in the system, I have to go by our standard billing procedures and what's on the legally approved statements. You don't want a callback for a corporate complaint team, I don't have to escalate your call above me tonight. As far as I'm concerned, the conversation's over.""
""[pause]...I HATE WHITE PEOPLE YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH!""
""ha ha ha good night ma'am.""~~And I'm in my call center trying not to bash my head against my desk. Because people don't enunciate. When I can't understand their mumbled jargon they get upset with me.    

If you're wanting me to pull up John Smith but you're pronouncing his name as Joam Smanes. That's on you.    

I had someone from another country calling in to verify information. The accent was so heavy I could almost not understand them. While verifying something they were using a made up phonetic alphabet and used ""I for imbecile"".~~We had to repo a Mustang from a guy in Philadelphia.  He bought it and his payments were about $400/month.   He was young and had a couple tickets and his insurance was $500/month!     He brought the car in, knowing he couldn't afford it and said his rent was only $800.   

&amp;#x200B;

I recommended he find a car he could buy for about $2000 cash and bank money to move out of the city.~~People like his suck the life out of me. Their knee jerk reaction to ANYTHING you say will be to argue with it before you even get your sentence completely out. Sometimes this works for them to get discounts because the person on the other end gets to the point they will do anything to get rid of them. Unfortunately they will also do this to those of us who work in house support and we aren't directly charging them anything. Perhaps verbally abusing others is their main thrill in life. They need to all go and live on their own island without any means to communicate with the outside world.~~I work third shift and had a trucker call and was troubleshooting on his tablet while driving. I asked if he can pull over. He said  no way, I make overnight my prime driving. No one on the road, with a cold beer I enjoy my drive  I was floored!~~Yeah, I understand! I get calls like that too! I once had a lady call me with the same problem. She did have the right policy, so I was going to sent someone to give her some fuel. I said that road  assistance was going to be with her in an hour. She answered: 'Oh, well then ill walk to the gasstation'. Turns out, it was a 5 minute walk for her! Uhh ok...~~Some people, you just really have to dumb it down for them. Sir, I would like to find your daughter's account. In order to do so, I need information to identify her. If you tell me her phone number, I will use it to search for her in my system. ~~All the customer service jobs I have worked, I will go above and beyond and do anything in my power to help customers that are kind and understanding. When people act like this, no way am I going to go out of my way to break policy for them. Why do they think acting like this is going to make anyone want to help them?~~I live in Spain and I once asked a customer if the rental he had was in Spain and he said no. I asked where it was then. He said the Canary Islands. I pointed out that's Spain, aka the country he's from and lives in, and he said ''I guess''.~~This reminds me of a story every training class is told where I work (at a mail order pharmacy). Besides HIPAA laws, there is extra reason why we are so stingy with information: some people can and will use whatever they can get to hurt others. You may not be that person, but we dont know that.

The story was about a lady who called in to ask if her husband's Viagra was ready for refill. She gave all the necessary information required by law for the rep to talk to her. So the rep said ""yes."" And she responded ""I fucking knew he was cheating.""~~Ha! My coworkers and I were just talking about these kind of people! 


My favorite is this guy who said he was unable to email us because he didnt have internet and he was in a wheelchair.


Now the internet makes sense but Im not sure how a wheelchair prevents you from emailing. 


And then he proceeds to email us over the next several weeks with links to his YouTube pages and asking questions.~~Wow indeed! First, sorry that you &amp; others are going to be losing your jobs because of a decision you have no control over. I've been there and it sucks.
But what an ignorant bitch! Lol I love how she didnt listen at all, just kept on talking. I've spoken to sooooo many customers exactly like her!~~We once had a customer who crashed into a column and destroyed the front of the car. He blames us for not telling him he couldn't drive into private government property (he crashed into a fucking courthouse which was surrounded by pillars so you don't drive there). He circumvented the pillars, lost control and crashed and said it's our fault we didn't warn him not to go there and wanted us to pay for the damages.~~When a little niggling detail like that happens repeatedly I might consider it valuable feedback for a possible webpage re-design.  Is there something making that necessary Type so overlookable?  Or if they overlook it does a more helpful error message pop up informing them that they must also fill in Type?~~Sounds like the attention to detail I have with people at my work.  Part of what I do is I help people with getting caught up on their past due bills.  Part of that is spreading out whats owed in increments so it can be added to the future bills to pay on as well.   

Trouble is some people dont listen to all of what we say that we explain ok so this will be broken up into x payments of $xx.xx a month on top of your x bills.    
They seem to not pay attention and clue in that theyll have to also pay their bills along with this too, theyll only pay the $xx that they were told will be added on their bills and think thats what will keep their services up to date.  

But then they call back in 2 months when they have a new disconnect notice and their arrangement defaulted wondering what the hell happened.~~I actually learned something from this.

As an occasional renter, if my rental was stolen from a parking lot, non violently, I would have called the rental office first and asked about lo jack or blue star, to shut down and track the car....

I just thought that's what they do/have... 

Edit: typos~~Sorry about that.  They get used to the special treatment from us in hospital IT and think it works everywhere.

They do that whole ""just get it done"" and slam the phone down thing to us too.  Doesn't work very well, because inevitably they've failed to tell us where they are so we can't actually do anything effective.~~&gt; . . . *and then started attacking the truck and hitting the windows*.    
&gt;  
&gt;The guy didn't care though and started saying that he was gonna go to  the BBB and tell all his friends and family how horrible we are and that  we're the most disgusting company he's ever dealt with.  

I would say ""Fine, but we will now call the police and press charges for assault.~~A caller once told my coworker to kill herself then go jump off a bridge and die...hmm... pretty sure if you succeeded at her first order, you would not be living to jump off the bridge and die again. Lol. Also just a terrible thing to say to a random person. Thankfully coworker has good sense of humor and found the absurdity of the insult command to be funny.~~Getting out of the call center industry was the best decision I have ever made. 

It's pretty much all I've done since I started working 25 years ago. I've done it all. I did years on the phones. Then sup, qa, workforce, training, ops manager, etc... Much of that at the same company in I was with for 15 years. 

I just got out on June 20th. Better money, MUCH better benefits, but most importantly, better quality of life. Call centers are STRESSFUL.~~I kind of miss roadside! I was awesome at finding people. There was *one* lady I couldn't find though. When I asked where she was she said she wasn't sure. Got the highway and it was an interstate. What state? ""I think I might be in Illinois, I'm not sure.""

Landmarks were a water tower with nothing on it and a cow. This was before street view and GPS on phones so I had to have her call 911. :(~~","The commenter had a call with someone trying to do a settlement and explained that they were not sympathetic to their situation.

5.0,"Ok guys let me explain.   In a truck yard, spots are mapped out for easy navigation.   C was told container he was to find was in spot X.  However he doesn't find it in spot X.   Yard dogs being how they are rushed all the time are not known to be exact in their duties and occasionally miss putting things exactly where they belong but will do as close as possible.  Thus container may not be in spot X but if you eyeball around and look at Spots Y, Z,W  and maybe U, you'll probably spot it.  Driver didn't want to look around was all.~~It never stopped them before, haha. When she came home with those one day I was wondering how long they were going to last. Went as well as one of feeders we had a long time ago that had a pressure moving grate that made it so squirrels couldnt get the bird feed. They just sat on top or clung to the tree and reached through. ~~This reminds me of a call I once had. The whole call was a doozy, but Ill skip to the end. Had to explain about when you run a business, you have to keep proper records. She says You mean those receipts and stuff? Tell her yes. She says We dont do that! Only white people do that!  It ended right after because she started yelling and cursing, so I hung up on her.~~Well at least taxis realize how bad they are!

The last taxi I took, the old man driver spent the whole 40-minute staring at me while creepily flirting instead of looking at the road, drove the opposite way on a one-way street for THREE blocks, then dropped me off 6 blocks away from my destination.

The taxi ride I had before that picked me up 20 minutes late, literally had a basket full of laundry in the back seat for me to sit next to, and was freaking out when she had to cross the main bridge of my city (Oh my god, I hope we make it across okay. I havent driven over this bridge in 20 years. Oh jesus! Its...literally the main bridge that connects our two towns. The only way to avoid it is to take a 3-hour detour...~~Our car broke down right after we got a loan for other car repairs (weird how that works). Luckily we broke down next to a small cafe/slots place in a conjoining parking lot. We bought some pizza and sat down in there while we waited for him to come. When he showed up he gave me my husband and my daughter all a ride to the battery specialist and luckily that fixed our issue. We also gave the tow truck driver pizza. He was so happy and thanked us a ton lol. My husbands like ""well it's the least we can do. You're helping us get our car back on the road."" It was also like 100 degrees that day. Thankful we were in a lot and not on the side of the road.~~I worked for a U.K. based recovery service and this was a common complaint. One customer needed his car and caravan (trailer) towed back to his home which was an 10-12 hour journey. While there were a couple of issues he was really surprised that this was done by different drivers in a relay. He expected the same driver to the entire journey and not have breaks. Even after I explained that once the driver left their patch and it was the responsibility of someone in the next area to take over he couldnt grasp the concept of legally mandated breaks or what the driver would do 500 miles from home at the end of the working day.~~Amazing job!  As someone who has worked in customer service for all my adult life, I can truly say you did an amazing job and went above and beyond the call of duty. That had to feel absolutely incredible to discover such an error and get the issue resolved. I admire your tenacity and dedication! Enjoy the W. :)~~This is anecdotal and totally NOT proof of anything.  When I was in grade school, my mom came to pick me up and ended up locking her keys in the car - a Ford Taurus wagon from like 1990.  We looked and looked for a way to get in until we found the groundskeeper for the school who also drove a Taurus I asked him to try and open the door.  My little kid brain thought same cars, same keys.  Right?!?  Turns out his ignition key was close enough to my moms door key that it unlocked our car and we were able to go home.  

TL:DR groundskeeper at my grade school drove a Taurus and could open our Taurus doors with his ignition key.~~","The commenter explains that in a truck yard, spots are mapped out for easy navigation, but the driver didn't find the container he was supposed to find in spot X.

6.0,"I live in the US, worked for a mobile company direct corporate. Had to hear this every. Single. Day. Explained multiple times why they still had to pay for the phone they broke. Tried multiple ways to make them understand. They still believed they were so entitled that they shouldn't have to pay for it.  We offer you insurance and you decline it's out of our hands. If you choose not to pay it'll go on your credit report. That's up to you.  Literally seen them leave the store and break the phone in the parking lot and then expect what? To return it? Wtf are we going to do with a broken phone? The stupidity of people. I had to leave that company the job was way too stressful.~~I had a similar situation when doing customer service/tech support for a middle tier cable company.  It was before Christmas and a woman calls wanting know why her bill was so high with VOD purchases.  I inform her of about 10 adult videos being purchased at anywhere from 11.99-13.99 a pop.  She goes quiet for a second and then says ""I have a 14 year old son who is expecting Christmas gifts, he's gonna be pissed when he don't get a goddamn thing.""  That was a solid gold moment there.~~Ive had a call centre tell me I had to get the primary account holder to call in personally to transfer the account holder from my husband to me. I was doing this because he had died. He, um, wasnt available. I literally had a let me speak to your manager moment. The manager was named Matt and I will never forget his kindness, but JFC.~~I had a lady call in complaining hubby was getting overages on his calls and texts wanting an explanation

I led her through the process of seeing her account online...where she could see what calls/texts are being made on all the lines of her account

I followed along and saw he was calling/texting a certain number day and night a hundred times a month...she recognized the number(her female neighbor)

She thanks me and says ""That SOB!"" 

To be a fly on the wall when he came home from work that afternoon!~~Thank you for posting this, OP. People can be so fucking dishonest. Pretty easy to track the owner of a phone. Or even turn them in to the police.

On a somewhat related note, people that give old, semi-functional phones to kids end up with police at their door, since old phones, bricked, no simcard, whatever, can still call 911.~~I worked for a phone company from 2005 until a couple of years ago.
Somewhere in my first year I received a phone call from an old dude with al couple of 100 worth of calls to 0906-lines. In my country, those numbers are designated as erotic lines (either talking to someone to get you off or an erotic story).
He asked us to take the charges off as he was a pastor, and would a pastor do such a thing?.
Internally, I thought Of course and I really wanted to say something witty, but I had to stay professional and told him that that was not for me to decide and he could take it up with the complaints board.~~I work for a pharmaceutical software company. And I just love it when they say, ""Well I'm going to leave! What do you have to say about that?"" Then I'll say... ""Ok.. let me get you over to accounting to gather your termination papers and calculate your breach of conduct fee (usually in the thousands)."" Then they say... Ugh... Fine.. when can you fix the problem?. Like it annoys me that people think threatening is a good way to handle business~~Before voice recognition technology really got its shit together my aunt had a phone where you could make calls via voice command if you set it all up. Except the clunky process of it all made her rather angry and she was yelling all the names down the phone. Afterwards if she wanted to actually use the function she had to try and sound angry so the program would recognise her and who she wanted to call. Great fun as the passenger, even better when she started to actually get angry at failed attempts and was suddenly angry enough to be recognised.~~I used to work in satellite TV. There were a LOT of calls about nobody in my house would watch porn pay-per-view!!! We could tell how the PPV was ordered.

Your husband that works until 2am? Watches porn when he gets home from work.

Your teenagers? They watch porn.

Your kids that came home from college over Christmas? They watched porn.

We would be accused of putting false PPV charges on accounts to make money, because they just could not accept that anyone in their household would order porn. But they did!~~Man, I hate calls about something the Store did. One time a store sold a phone to the guy who failed the credit check. So, he walked out with just paying a small setup amount, the computer caught it and about 20 minutes later auto billed him for the full price of the phone because of the fail credit check he couldn't get a contract with us. This of course put him over the spending limited on his account, shutting the phone off. Had to explain to him, why the phone wasn't working, yes, he owes 1,000 bucks for the phone and had to pay before he got service. etc. ~~&gt;I work dealer support for a Canadian telecom company, got a call yesterday from a store that I've dealt with before, always some kind of BS with them. Customer came in wanting to change his plan to a ""10GB plan for $100"", on the second highest tier with a brand new phone. 

I physically recoiled when I saw that and for a second time when I read it was considered cheap. 

My plan (albeit without a phone) is 15 ($25.50 Canadian) for *unlimited* data. If you were a new customer unlimited data (still without phone mind) is double that~~I once had a customer insist that her remote only had one battery, even vehemently argue. I waited several minutes for her to go to the garage and get the ONE battery. She pulled the old one and VIOLA, there were two, like I said. OH was all she said. It was worth the time wasted while she went back to the garage for the second one.~~The I'm gonna sue types are always hilarious. If you can afford someone who charges hundreds daily, you can afford to pay a $100 bill.

If an attorney offered services expecting a lawsuit to cover expenses, a judge isn't going to let even be a case. ""Your Honor, my client deserves money because they used services without paying and the company had the nerve to ask my client to pay their bill.""

I don't know why customers think this bluff is magic cheat code to get free shit.~~&gt; Why can't all these high-rolling customers that are worth thousands of dollars an hour take care of the most mundane things? You don't think they're lying, do you? Nah, never OUR customers.

I mean, having spent a lot of time working for various Very Important People, they do have a certain... inability to function in daily life. Why do you think they spend so much money on assistants? There's something about being at a certain level that just makes you amazingly nonfunctional as a human being. I genuinely worry about some of these people.~~Man, formerly used to work for some fruity companies doing tech support and I had this little old lady, who upon telling her I couldn't help her with her google password issue, went silent for 3-4 seconds, and then with every ounce of righteous indignation she could muster, yelled ""WELL DON'T YOU OWN THE GOOGLES?!""

Never laughed so hard right into a customers ear before in my life. ~~When I worked for a big bank call center in the US I had someone call up once because hundred of dollars were always disappearing from her account every month. It was her entitled POS preteen/teenager son making countless purchases on her card every month. HUNDREDS of dollars on the playstation. I felt so bad for her.~~Nice, quickly defused the situation, she was actually reasonable, *to a point*.  You got off *way* too easy!      
  What's your work #?  I need to call you and demand my 12!  NOW!  Because I'm extra extra special with ground unicorn horn sprinkles!  So if *everyone else* is getting the 11, I deserve a 12!!  NOW!WHATAREYOUWAITINGFOR?!?!~~I used to work at a small business to business phone company in my country.
At one point in time, shady sms subscriptions were a big problem, so the government and phone companies made a website where you could find the info on how to get rid of them (as the owners of these services made it deliberately obtuse).
Still, we had some users who found it difficult to navigate the site so we would help them out. Also, it was mainly the office people calling on behalf of the (for the most part) construction workers.
One of my co-workers, a nice enough guy but pretty loudmouthy, said to the customer well maam, Ill loo it up for you, and Ill phone you back with the code you need.
5 minutes later he had to call the 60-something lady to tell her that she needed to sms ANALSEX OFF to a number.
Never heard him speak that softly.~~I once had a grown man break down and cry on the line when I told him that he would have to pay full price for the latest iPhone ( iPhone 4 back then). 

I'm not talking fake sniff sniff tears, I'm talking full on desperation, ""my life is going to end if I don't get this phone yesterday"" type of deal.

This is my number one reason for hating Apple. They cause so much ferver over every new device they release. And people buy into that shit! It is absolutely mind blowing especially now with the 6plus. How in the proper fuck can it be suddenly ok to have a ginormous phone now that Apple made one when you were making fun of the Samsung Galaxies and the Notes for being ""so huge""!

Apple cultists, yes that's what they are, are the worst kind of customer to deal with.~~&gt;I think I'll go online and share this negative experience!!!

This is what annoys me about customers. Whenever they don't get their own way it's a ""negative experience"". Bitch, what you are asking is illegal. You are being told NO because what you want to do is against the law.

If you call and the agent immediately calls you a cunt that's a ""negative experience"", being refused something because you are an idiot is not a ""negative experience"".~~I worked for a tv/internet provider, and my favourite thing was to explain to mothers/wives that their kid/partner had been watching porn. 


They'd call in asking why their bill is high, and we could just tell them outright what it was. ""Oh yes, there was a 13.99 charge for lesbian vampires 2."" ""Right, I'm going to have a chat with him.""~~I thought the customer was being sassy and meant something along the lines of ""I have needed to turn the modem off and on again for it to work so many times, and getting up to do it every time is giving my legs veins."" Still, your version was even funnier.~~","The commenter worked for a mobile company and had to deal with customers who broke their phone in the parking lot and still had to pay for it.

I will never understand the logic behind people who have issues paying their bills on time &amp; than demand the newest phones for FREE on the highest tier. Chances are...even if they did do the upgrade....theyd call back to complain why their bill is SO high. Well sir... you cant have your cake &amp; eat it too. Smh!~~Get used to it. 

If you can, disconnect the call immediately once you've said bye. It's no fun listening to someone who thanked you, without sarcasm, start to call you every name in the book to whoever happened to be in the room with them. Scratch that, sometimes it's fun.~~&gt;Impulse control brought me to say yes, even me own mum

There is an old joke about an applicant for a police officer position being asked what he would do in various scenarios. They asked him what he would do if he pulled over a car and realized the driver was his mother. He replied ""call for backup.""~~She didn't think of this ahead of time? Or couldn't have had a friend or family, or don't hospitals have free wi-fi that she could have used? I mean, if I'm pushing out a tiny human being, I don't think I'd really be focused on my cell phone data. I'd take the pictures and then, when I was feeling better, I'd worry about sharing the photos......~~I've had to explain to people before that on an average monthly bill of *X* amount, our company makes a small profit from them of *Y* dollars a month (some small total way, *way* lower than X), and if I give them the Y + whatever ridiculous amount they are asking for, then I would be defeating the purpose of our company even servicing them as customers many times over.

So no, Karen, I will not be crediting you your entire monthly bill, because with the way you're acting, there's no locked-in-for-sure promise for us that you'll be here the next three years straight without incident for us to make that money up.~~""I understand you're in a tough place, so we can work together on this. From my understanding, you will lose out on tens of thousands if your services are turned off. We don't want to give your card information over the phone, and I see the closest store location to you is about five miles away. I'd like your opinion on this, but it seems to me going to the store would be the most cost effective option.""~~Those customers are fun. I also work for a large Telecom and the ""'I'll switch to another carrier!"" types can piss off.

It's like customers think we have some magical switch to give only them some made up pricing. Yep, we totes have a button to override what corporate sets. You're an adult, you don't need someone kissing your ass to stick with a company. True adults choose service that suits their needs, not cry over small pricing differences.~~Not the same situation, but I once got a guy on the phone three separate times within 30 minutes, which if you knew the size of my call center is ridiculous odds. He had the same voice, same phone number calling in, but claimed different names and account numbers. I had fun flagging down my Team Lead and creating multiple fraud reports for that one, lol. I hope he gets caught and taken for all hes worth.~~Pro tip: If youre in this situation in the UK you submit a DSAR request to the company and they then have to send you a copy of all communication on their system that you ask for. I think its part of GDPR.

I used this tactic with EE recently where theyd told me I could cancel a contract with no charge after 3 months and after those 3 months, guess what. 500 charge for the whole remaining contract. DSAR request and it suddenly went away because they found my call, listened to it and found out Id been lied to.~~I've only had the pleasure of visiting Vancouver a few times - seemed like cold California to me.  None of my coworkers up there could recommend me to a good poutine place (lots of seafood and Asian places that are great).  What makes an excellent poutine?  Curds, greasy sausage gravy, steak fries?

Here in the US, we love our greasy foods, but I understand that your poutine is a hug on a plate.~~All three of mine did this as children. I knew what was up and called my phone carrier, had them put a stop to it. No authorization to use the phone to pay for anything related to apps. I still paid the bill though. The boy with his xbox was a bit harder to wrangle when it came to using my credit card and debit cards willy nilly. I had to take the game system away for several months to get a point across and then closely monitor charges in case he needed another lesson.  It's frustrating as a mom because they think what's mom's is also theirs.  And it's not.~~&gt;Boss Lady ""HOLY HELL MOOMATIC, IS SHE HITTING ON YOU OR IS SHE DRUNK? DID SHE SAY BABY OIL?

~~I worked for an energy provider, got a call from a woman with depression, her son was on drugs, dealers broke her windows and she had the gas turned off (but was still paying DD for years). After learning her entire life story I was able to give her back something like 2 grand because of a negative balance in an account she didn't know about. She didn't really understand so it took ages to explain that this is her money. It happens a lot, keep an eye on your accounts (especially when you close them).~~Regarding #3: I can relate to everything in that story, and I hate it! First of all, it is a blatant show of disrespect when a sup caters to the customer and disregards everything you just said. The customer is not always right. And it is so annoying when a customer says do this then hangs up. They dont seem to realize that we have to have them on the line. Because if we change things without them on the line, theyll just call back again down the line and bitch about how we did something without permission. ~~yeah that wasnt on you. it was on the cheater, he ""fuck around and found out"". I cant stand a cheater.   Wife and I will celebrate 24 years of marriage this year and I couldnt imagine ruining what we have built in all the years. Why do people cheat is beyond me. When they feel like stepping out then they should break up at first w current significant other~~Had a lady who ordered a phone online...one millisecond after finishing the order she had an epiphany and immediately called us

She wanted to go to a nearby store and pick it up right then...she had the idea once ordered it magically appeared in the store and while they could send it to her address that would take too long

I asked her why she didn't just go to the store instead of ordering it online and she said she didn't know she could do this

I was speechless...for a couple of seconds anyway and said something I couldn't help saying

I asked her didn't she know a camera store would have cameras there to sell without ordering online first?

She was silent and then hung up...I was lucky she never got a survey to fill out or I'd of had some 'plaining to do~~Best way Ive found for the its not my responsibility anymore angle is to tell them that it is there property and that if the other party refuses to return it we can list it as stolen, not wrong since its the account owners and they are paying for it. If they want to play nicer with the 3rd party they can always tell them to take possession of the line or they will list the device as stollen which is effectively the case. 
Where I work that would transfer the Comintment to the 3rd party and usually can get them to be a bit more friendly. 
That said Ive only had this work like 60% of the time~~Best porn call I ever had was from a father who understood immediately that I was telling the truth about the extra charges being from porn. He figured immediately that his two preteen sons must have bought it.

""I guess I'll have to put child locks on,"" he sighed, before making the mistake I am sure he regrets to this day. ""Out of curiosity... what are they into? What they did they buy.""

After a long pause, I told him: Mennonites Gone Wild.

""Mother of God.""~~When I was like 12-14 I had some online friends. One guy called my cell phone a couple times for a minute or two here and their and then once for like an hour. 

It was free for me because it was an incoming call but he lived on the other side of the country. 

A few weeks later I get a call that I answer, and it's their phone provider who called the number to question the charge. 

They said they never made the call. The guy could definitely tell I was really young and kept telling me I wasnt in trouble. 

I told him their son called me and he said ok thanks and hung up. 

I was terrrrified.~~Lol. The customers who are out for 1 or 2 days service, but want a huge credit. Yes, because your 76 dollar per month service really warrants a 500 dollar credit.

I'm crediting 5 dollars and thats it. People wonder why rates go up, its because credit hungry Assholes who call in from the depths of Hades for their 280 credit.

~~I ran into this at a call center for a cell company I worked at. 

People would refuse to tell us their phone numbers because it is supposed to be a secret. Then, I would ask for the social to look up the account. This would cause some to flip out because the government is listening and they might steal the social security number. 

Like, look assholes. How am I supposed to access your account to help you if you won't provide any info. ~~Bought a car once and tried to pair a device - all five Bluetooth slots were filled. Weird but ok, just have to listen to the voice recorded nicknames and delete them all.

Turns out all of them were progressively louder and angrier versions of Bobs Cell. By the fifth one my wife and I couldnt see straight we were laughing so hard at the monotone voice menu and the sudden bursts of Bobs obvious frustration.~~","The commenter works in telecommunications and often receives calls from customers who want to upgrade their phones for free, but the system won't let them until their past due balance is cleared. The commenter suggests that the customer should call back to complain about the high bill. They also suggest that the customer"
6.0,"LOL, I was that co-worker once! At the time, I sat next to a lovely girl who moved from Florida to Oregon, and we became wonderful work friends, but the first time she spoke fluent  spanish with a guest, I was floored! She has no accent what so ever, and after her normal english intro, she switched to spanish for the remainder of the call, and even got a sale out of it! Come to find out, her parents emigrated from Columbia, her mother still speaks 90% spanish, while her dad is more 50/50, so she had to be the family translator for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

After spending more time with her, and hearing her on personal calls, it was so interesting hearing her switch effortlessly between two languages, and she would always switch to spanish when she was pissed off! It was great!~~I used to work a wireless company, the red one.

Same thing!

I knew a lot of people though the wireless industry. Its all the same. But red and three letters were always the worst at doing it and the best at covering it up.

Im glad to have quit.

Im sorry your going through that! I worked in the store and would legit hear co workers lying to people. No matter the person.

We were instructed to add a line at any cost. Granny on fixed income? Needs a line. Struggling single dad? Needs a tablet line! Just lost your partner and want to disconnect? How about a line for your grandson!~~I work for a call center as of recently and it's ridiculous how many people don't look at their bill. I had a guy tonight tell me he just pays his bill through our website and he called tonight to tell me to credit charges that were made on his account because a representative removed the feature from his phone line for international calling. Well as of right then he had had it on his account removed for 3 months... so I couldn't do anything.

Read your bills people. That's what they're there for.~~I work in an inbound centre, but occasionally have to call customers back for whatever reason... we cant press hash or any other number once a call has started, (God knows why) so if Ive arranged to call you back and you have call guardian... you aint never getting that callback.~~No one wants to hear you rant for 15 minutes, I've heard it before from other customers, and you have repeated that very same thing 3 times now and it's making me care less every time.

Not paying your bills is the easiest way to get on a shit list.

Threatening to cancel when you owe hundreds of dollars is just asking to be harassed by a non-negotiating collector.

It's like he was projecting his failure to be responsible onto you. Prorbably because he was.~~LMAO, woooow. xD

To be totally honest, I had one of those moments just the other day, and it also came the morning after a HUGE nacho dinner made with pinto beans, beef, cheese and veggies. I was in the middle of a call for a flat tire service, which are quick 5-10 minute calls, thankfully.

Do you all have to follow a script precisely, or can you tell customers that you're waiving the fee, and they can now pay their usual bill in full? It seems like bringing monetary amounts into the equation is causing unnecessary difficulties.~~If you keep shouting/talking over me, I cannot help you.

I actually do use this one, with no consequence at work.  

As well as:  Im sorry, you seem to think you know more about XYZ than I do, and I have all the manuals in front of me.  Im not sure why you are calling for help if you know my jobs better than me.~~Their customer service is atrocious and they dont even know their products. I call about my wireless internet box (needed a new battery/under warranty) I get sent to direct tvor I get sent to the claims dept for mobile phones which is all recordings not actual people. I have never spoke to a single rep who knew what I was referring to. I gave up and ordered a battery off Amazon after they finally sent me new box (kudos bc that box was broken) and guess what, new box came WITHOUT the battery. I sent their new device back with a note telling them to learn their products and after being on the phone 12 hours total getting a broken box I didnt need was like buying already melted ice cream, pointless.

They also hate me bc Im grandfathered into a plan from 15 years ago and their loosing money because I wont change a single thing that would lose my $25 unlimited internet. ~~I understand. 

The sad thing is,  we're now getting people who think a sob story is what's going to get them free stuff. 

At my call center,  we're now getting people who need a service,  and it's because someone passed away or is in hospital or something similar.  This is called in through a 3rd party between us and the customer. 

They have the audacity to state that I'm running their life,  that I should have more compassion, how I'm going to prevent them from seeing their relative one last time. 

And I hear them typing as they do this,  and that they're in a call center,  and their neighbors are doing the same thing to someone else. 

Not saying that's what you experienced at all,  but with that remark of seeing them on the news, I was reminded of this. 

*note- the caller pretends to be the customer in this situation~~Some people here in Germany are concerned with ""Elektrosmog"", radiation induced sicknesses whereas the radiation is that emitted by cell phone towers, electronic devices etc.
What Chuck McGill from Better Call Saul had. 

It's super dumb IMHO. 

Anecdotal story time:

New cell phone tower is put up in a small village in the boonies. People start complaining about sudden headaches obviously caused by all that radiation from the tower. Town hall meeting with the telecom company that put the tower up. Spokesperson is super concerned and takes the concerns very seriously.

He ends the session with 'I dread to think about what happens when we turn the tower on!'~~A loooong time ago, my friend's mom wanted to buy the new hot phone for all three of her kids. She saw a great deal offered by her cell service, open a new line and get a massive discount on the new hot phone. So she cancelled the family plan and opened four new plans, and then was fLaBbErGaStEd! She was surprised to learn that not only do four individual cell plans cost more than a group family plan, but also surprised that she lost the ""long-term customer"" discounts she had been getting on her bill for years.~~Never understood parents that dont research the devices their kids r using. My parents were no where near tech savvy (had difficulties programming the damn thermostat) but before we were allowed to play on anything they made sure to go thru the manuals and set up any and all safety features it offered that they thought were necessary. We couldnt even watch r rated movies on our PS2 without asking one of them to put in a 4 digit code before hand~~It can be rather strange to receive a censored text from someone (my wife's phone does the same thing when she uses voice typing -- the number of asterisks indicate that the phone knows *exactly what she meant* but it still won't type it out for her). The first time I got a text like that I responded ""you have touched my penis. You're allowed to say 'fuck' to me"".~~I used to work in a complaints department for one of the big phone networks here in the UK and the stores were such a fucking pain for misselling. Their KPI's are set so high they will do absolutely anything in order to secure a sale. They used to sell customers a handset plan plus a sim only to go with it so they'd make a big commission and customers wouldn't know until they realize two amounts are coming out of their accounts. I feel for you bud~~I currently work for a Canadian telco as a cross-trained billing and technical support specialist. I had the pleasure of speaking to a woman complaining about international calls made on her phone. Turns out she was making calls to Portugal on her landline when she only has unlimited Province-wide calling. 

I tried to explain to her multiple times that I can only reverse the charges if she adds an international calling plan to her account, but she's not having it.  She even told me I was holding her hostage by refusing to help in exchange for a sale.  I was adamant however that this is the current process.  She hung up but not without telling me that I'm a piece of shit. 

A month later her account went to collections.

Edit: grammar~~My Grandmother actually did stop paying after a situation just like this, got an at the time new Nokia N95 and whilst on holiday in Spain it got stolen and Orange wouldnt replace it so she just stopped paying them. Im in Northern Ireland so naturally nothing ever happened bar a default on her credit file, she was amazed when they gave me a contract years later with her at the same address and likely blacklisted.~~The practices of this company are why Ill never use them again. They wont get my money. I purposely shop for places to live where I can use an ISP that isnt them. 

They let go all of their contracted workers in 2015. We heard rumors there was warning for other companies but we had none. Like, I clocked into work one day, went on break, and couldnt sign into the system when I was back. No one knew what was going on. 

That three letter company is a bad word to me now.~~Surveys should not be used as a metric. You can't please every one, every time. And when people get mad at the situation, they lash out through surveys. They think the company will change its policies, rather than punish the random person who took the call.

If you follow my posts, you've seen me say it a million times: CSATs, surveys, Net Promoter Score, and all that is statistical garbage. It means nothing.

~~I used to work for a phone network in the UK too and the charges on their bill would be reocurring for visiting certain naughty sites. We could give the name of the site out and i used to get fathers and mothers phone in all the time and I had to let them know their sons phone was subscribed to things like ""Super Squirting Mayhem"" and shit like that~~Ugh. I had so many calls like that when working support for a certain fruit based company and AOL accounts.  The settings AOL had originally given were out of date and they took their sweet time updating so we could push to customers. Trying to get people to download an app so they could check mail was like talking to a pissed off wall sometimes.~~",The commenter used to work in the wireless industry and shared a story about a co-worker who switched to Spanish after speaking fluent Spanish for the first time. The commenter is glad to have quit the industry and thinks it's unfair for employees to lie to customers. They also express frustration with customers
6.0,"I work for an ISP and I'm trying to think how we would have handled that initial customer call.... and I've got nothing. The agent would either put the call on hold and say ""Oh you are not going to believe this one!"" to the cube farm at large or type it up real time in our group chat.  Probably we would say we have no idea, maybe call your doctor, but possibly suggest they return the modem &amp; get a different brand.

I am going to have to add ""Suggest they call cell phone provider"" to our ""Things to Suggest When the Problem Isn't Us"" FAQ.~~If she bought the phone somewhat recently it shouldnt be locked. Hasnt it been a couple years now since they legally have to sell them unlocked &amp; unlock old ones for free? 

Mind you I could see this happening if it was a phone shes had for quite a while.~~Its the sort of thing you'll get used to. The longer you spend in the job, the less time it'll take you to talk people through these things, even when they're being stupid.

In 7 months I went from taking 20 minutes to fix a 'my bbm isn't working' call, to taking less than 5 minutes. You learn both what and how to say it. 

Also, it was incredibly unprofessional of your manager to get on the line whilst you were there and ask her with you listening in. ~~I recently worked for a large online car dealership. The number of people who would voluntarily freeze or put warnings on their credit and then ask for financing is insane. And then having to explain that yes, we do need to run the credit again, we need to confirm that freeze/warning is gone... oh man, they flipped their shit. I always wanted to tell them that they did this, its not our fault.~~Last week one of my coworkers had a woman requesting he wipe out her past due balance on her cell phone bill. Her reasoning is because she went to college and that was so expensive so she should not have to also pay a cell phone bill. Not side what one has to do with the other.~~i had a customer call me up once back in the days when celphones were still pretty new and companies charged 15 cents for every text message sent. He had gotten his 2 grandaughers each a phone for Christmas and in the week and a half before he called me , they racked up over $1100 in texting charges. He was freaked! I helped him cancel the phones and waived the fee for him. Told him to tell their parents that the girls had to get jobs to pay him back!~~my favorite when i worked for comcast was getting calls like this over adult movies.  


I'd tell the caller I can look up which cable box ordered the movie, and, if they claimed it was ordered on accident, we could tell how long anything pay per view was watched, if it was an accidental purchase you'd see something like 3 minutes of a 4 hour programming block, i'd happily refund those, then tell them about putting a password lock any ppv programming (this happened more for regular ppv movies than adult ones mind you)   


Well maam...it looks like it was one of the bedroom boxes, labeled little Jimmy's room etc.

...those calls usually ended with mom shouting ""Goddammit Jimmy!"" into the distance and hanging up, good times.~~If he got the phone with a 2 year contract he could have upgraded, renewed his contract and made sure to put an extended warranty feature on the account. Depending on the carrier of course. There's also 3rd party places that do sell phone repair.

It pisses my off that most of the people who call in don't think of all the things the could do. They just want us to press the magic button and fix all their problems. ~~I had a friend say this to me, about 5 months ago!! She thought she was being all smart because her phone battery lasted longer in this mode she had found but wasn't getting any signal so had no calls, texts of anything coming through.

She had been putting her phone in to airplane mode until she got out of work...~~My cards not working. Thats because there wasnt enough money in your account to make the purchase. What does that mean?  Your balance is 5.00 and your purchase was for $12. What does that mean? You dont have enough to make your purchase. How come? Because 5 is less than 12. I dont understand. You dont understand why your balance is only $5 (thinking there had been a mixup).  No. I just dont get why my card declined. 
I shit you not. Financial literacy is appalling.~~One time I was skiptracing a guy  and I found property he had in another state with his parents valued at over $1,000,000.  When I called the house, the wife answered and I told her about the delinquent bill. She said cannot pay.  I asked if they could sell some of that property in the other state.  

Her response?

WHAT PROPERTY?  She was unaware of the property. Turns out her soon to be ex husband was hiding assets.  he had to sell it at a loss, give her half and his parents 2/3rds of his half.  He was not happy when he called in.  And paid it off.~~Sounds like he knew he owes money and was trying to get out of it somehow.  Playing the sob story to guilt you into helping him with the request he has for free services is something I see all the time on where I work as well at a call center.  

People bring up their kids, their elderly parents on life support, their health, anything they can think of to get you to feel bad and give in to whatever they want.~~Good for you standing your ground. 

As  a doctor, he's clearly not lacking the capacity to understand; he's just come over all entitled. 

What a shame that he now doesn't have a working machine, when you probably could have helped him. 

Still, time is money, eh? And now he can use some more of his, to buy a new computer instead of talking to a lowly customer service person! 
~~Reminds me of a guy that removed himself from ebill that has a discount assoisiated with it at 6% and kept telling me that we were penalizing him for wanting a bill in the mail. I kept telling him that if he doesn't receive his Bill by email which is the required action to get this discount we can not give it to him (legally because insurance discounts are technical as hell) and he isn't penalised but he isn't rewarded with a discount. He demanded we credit him for the same amount as the discount would have been so he can get a paper bill. To which I gleefully replied ""that is 100% illegal and I can not put a credit on your insurance. If you want this law to change contact local law makers""  
He called me a couple names then hung up and called to have the same conversation with a co-worker. ~~Oh man, I used to work in the US for an SMS aggregator. We enabled the messaging (and premium charges if applicable) but didn't run any of the actual programs/campaigns; those were run by other companies that were customers of ours. 

Used to get calls like this one ALL. THE. TIME. It was usually some kid who had subscribed to get ringtones or something. Adult content was pretty restricted in the U.S. market, but some of our clients operated chat lines that were pretty explicit. We got the ""spouse call"" multiple times. 

Left that industry a few years ago. Not long after I left, I heard that the major U.S. wireless carriers shut down all premium campaigns. ~~I work in a cc call center, and if I had a dollar for every time I got a similar call... yeesh. Especially for Amazon prime. I dont recognize this charge and did not authorize it.
Me: it looks like this is the monthly billing charge for Amazon  Prime, which provides free two-day shipping on most items. Does that sound familiar? 
Card member: no, I didnt sign up for that. 
Me: have you had the opportunity to go to your amazon account online and check to see if you have a Prime membership on your account? 
CM: yes and Im not. (Which I know is a huge lie because Ive taken and cancelled Prime at least three times myself.) 
I wish people would just fess up and say yes they did do whatever action theyre paying for.~~I worked CC fraud at a... *major bank in the USA*... and more than once, I had to discuss charges with some guy who kept getting scammed by some kind of Russian mail order bride dating site.

 I gambled on QA pulling the call, but I told him: Listen, if youre serious about meeting a foreign woman, scrape together some cash, and find an agency in New York that will set up a trip to Russia or something. Theyre legitimate, and youll be introduced to lots of *real women*, in person!

Either QA never listened to those calls, or they figured I was giving him good advice ~~I definitely agree about the whole get a case situation. Whenever I see ads for new phone colours I just think to myself ""who the fuck cares?"" the majority of people use cases anyway so the colour of the phone does not matter one bit. If this guy dropped his iPhone and broke it, maybe he should invest in a case on these new phones. ~~I once had to out a guy to his mother. It was her account, called to inquire about a charge of $24.99 on the bill. Her son's line had downloaded a gay dating app and accidentally billed it to the account. She asked me what the app was, I tried to tell her it was a dating app without giving too much away, but ultimately I had to tell her what it was. She was like ""oh my, I had no idea he was gay."" It was a really awkward call.~~I'm an American working in a Canadian call center, and all the call centers for our business are in Canada.     


But sometimes clients get someone with an accent (since we service clients in multiple languages, so having native Cantonese or Mandarin employees is essential).   So it always amuses me when I get a call that starts with ""Oh my goodness, I'm glad I'm speaking with a Canadian today.""   When in fact my coworkers with accents are Canadian, and I'm not.~~That sounded cathartic, I really hope you feel better after writing it!

&gt;When you upgrade you have to anticipate that new phones will be &gt;released in the next two years. 

I'm an Android user, but I'm fairly sure that each September Apple announce a new phone. It's not like it's that much of a surprise that they refresh the line every year, is it?~~I have a similar story, in which I am the customer.

Someone who I had a restraining order against posted on yahoo questions/answers asking where to find me. I had that restraining order for a reason. Yahoo answers refused to take down the post, despite me showing them that this person was supposed to have no contact with me.

All it would take is them using their Admin powers to delete a post... Posts get deleted all the time, right? Nope. They would not do it.~~",The commenter works for an ISP and is trying to figure out how they would handle a customer who claimed to have a locked phone. They suggest that the customer should call the ISP to see if they can unlock the phone for free. They also share a personal experience of dealing with a customer who claimed
6.0,"This should surprise me, but I've already posted what dumbfucks my colleagues are. I once dealt with a fraud case that a colleague did. The colleague in question lied on his credit card and overdraft application. He lied about dividend payments too. 

What he failed to understand though is that he may fool one or two agents with his shit but he can't fool an entire team. His wages were *high* as in lower middle class lifestyle high. I have no idea what he was thinking.~~I stopped talking about my phone plan with people, cause anyone who is with the same dog branded company wants it and thinks I can somehow get it for them.

$80/month for unlimited calling (within Canada), unlimited text (international), VM, call display, 10gigs + 5gigs free

My only advice is pay your phone bill in full, and on time. That's all I've done.~~I have the same job but in Canada. Its the same with both Apple and Samsung preorders. We sometimes have a paired offer (Phone + tablet is one that comes to mind).  It always says while supplies last.  And for the first few weeks all is good. Then someone calls to preorder a day or two before the actual launch and ship dates and then freaks out because we dont have the paired item. Then they demand a manager who tells them the same thing. Then they attempt to go over that managers head. They dont seem to get that resources arent infinite. And that I can remain calm and keep repeating myself because I live with teenagers ~~Used to hate the ones that declined an offer and tried to call back later.  Sorry, you should have taken it when it was offered.  The offer was discretionary based upon your sob story.  Based upon the notes, you have completely changed the story, so the offer will not be extended at this time.~~Gads people are stupid. I have gotten phones for my children and I multiple times through a cell phone company. Each time they always explain that Id be paying x for service and x monthly until the phone is paid off if it want to finance it. I also always get insurance because all it takes is one stupid fumble :p.~~I continue to be amazed each day at the trivial, stupid issues that folks call in to tech support for. We usually have a 15-20 min wait for a regular customer service agent, then another possible 30-45 minute wait for tech support. Then they whine &amp; moan about the wait time, when they are calling for something that could absolutely be handled by self care on our website. Really grinds my gears! ~~I took time off work and I'm so damn happy it happened to be when the 6 is released. I HATE dealing with iPhone related crap. We have phones of a similar spec that we can do for 20 less a month and we can even discount that further, but people have seen family members with them and just HAVE to have it. ""Why should I pay so much, I only need it to make calls. I don't use any of that internet stuff""


Fucking idiots.~~Can confirm entitled assholes who need hand holding through everything.

""I updated to iOS 8, now my phone is telling me to connect to iTunes. What do I do""? Well, have you tried.... connecting it to iTunes you moron!

Of course... they never have a backup either so loose everything.~~I've said this twice today already, but it bears repeating again.  I will *never* understand why people get so worked up over the iPhone.  It's not a bad phone, but it's overhyped and grossly overpriced.  I had an iPhone for a total of about 4 years - a 3GS for the first 3 years and a 4S for the last year.  Now that I'm leaving my job, I had to hand the iPhone 4S back.  I made the jump to Android (**not** a Samsung Galaxy - an HTC One m7) and couldn't be happier.  For a phone that was already a year or two old when I bought it, it had the advantage of being free on a low-level plan and still runs beautifully.~~I did the exact same job for an evil red corporation in the US. I love the people that say that they haven't used their phone while overseas. 

After I read out the exact amounts of data and which days they were in various countries they stop disputing the charges and change to negotiation mode. ~~A decade or so, I used to work for Sprint, as BlackBerry tech support.

My absolute FAVORITE thing?  When the customer was calling from their phone, and troubleshooting would require a Master Radio Reset.

I would ask if they were calling from their phone, and of course caller id told me they indeed were, but I was nice and thought I would give them the beneift of the doubt.

100% of the time, they would say no, I'm not on my phone, just fix it.

Ok great, I can get that fixed for you!

Do this step on your phone, then this step, and however many more steps required, because I don't remember.  And of course, the FINAL step, which would RESET the phone, would disconnect the call.

Do I regret it?  Of course, because that was horrible customer service.~~I have some friends that have heard me dealing with irate customers.  When decide they've had enough, they say they pull a ""SumoNinja"".  It gets the Karen off the phone and hurts her brain, mission accomplished.  It goes something like this:

"" I have been a customer for over 20 years and I want the phone now ""

So.

There's something about ""so"" that both infuriates them and knocks them off their game.  When they're really bad, that's all I say.   I realize you can't do it in a call center.  I got away with it because I own the agency.  

But when I read her argument for the entitlement of getting the phone now, I heard my answer in my head....so?~~I will say this:  the best skiptracing tool is the disgruntled ex who is not getting her child support/alimony!

I had one give me her ex's phone number, his parents number, his work number,  his gf number, his other gf number, and his OTHER GF number.  None of whom knew of the other.  Yeah, he had a bad months after that.  he did end up paying the delinquent bill.

and when he went past due again, his phone numbers did not work so I called the ex again. and gee, when Child support and visitation is involved, she has to have a good number....~~Yup, we all do that or the let me put you on hold, hoping the douche will simply hang up. 

I had an escalation once that was enough to give my manager a headache (and as usual, nothing a manager could do except tell the douche that I was correct and he needed to get over it). He was asking help from someone who after answering the questionwalked by my desk and ""bumped"" the receiver when no one was looking. Got back to my desk and there was a sigh of relief all around. ~~At DickTV when they said

""How can you increase my price after 2 years of it being the same!?""

 I'd answer 

""Well, could you name another service/product with the same price as 2 years ago?. I'm actually surprised you've been paying the same amount for anything after all this time"" 

They usually hung up after that ~~Me: Walk me through the specific steps you are doing.

Customer: I put in the info and nothing happens.

Me: Can you tell me exactly what you are doing please?

Customer: Just nothing happens.

Me: Ok, start from the top and tell me *exactly* what you are doing and what error, if any, you are getting.

Customer: It just doesn't do anything.


Me: Can you please try and tell me what happens?

Customer: Nothing happens.


And round and round we go until it (always) turns out there is an error and its pretty specific.

I have a case of the mondays.~~I used to get people calling about their car not working with their new phone all the time.  It never ceases to amaze me how they would be indignant that they $800 phone doesnt work, and theyd say that their $125k car was a piece of shit because if it.  Its a lemon, buy it back.~~This is exactly why I noted accounts ""Customer requested credits A, B, and C. This isn't valid due to X,Y, &amp; Z.  Did not grant or promise to grant these credits."" I'm not going to grant ridiculous unneeded credits, and I'm not going to let a lying customer claim that I did.~~I totally feel your pain! 
I used to work in a shop for a popular blue and white mobile network in the UK. If I had a quid for every time I dealt with this exact query, Id never need to work again! 
We dont offer the insurance just for commission - which was a handful of points you had to put towards a gift voucher. We do it because we dont want this conversation in a few weeks/months time.~~Damn. Some lady yesterday kept giving me the phone number to look up her account and nothing came up. She was yelling, asking me if I was def, literally said Im horrible finally reads me the number again and its different. 

Towards the end shes still calling me awful and I was like if you keep calling me names I will hang up and you can explain yourself to the next agent. Sudden silence ~~~""Oh, sir I see you're on a residential account. Apparently there was a mistake when your account was classified and pricing was determined. Running a business on a residential account is a violation of our TOS, let me just forward that to our business department so we can get your plan changed over to a business plan. No sir, I'm happy to help!""~~Ugh. I had the (kind of) opposite happen to me. I was leaving the country for a trip in a week, and I didn't want to accidentally be charged overseas roaming. So I called my provider (rhymes with purgin) and say ""I'm leaving the country on (insert travel date). Is it possible to schedule a temporary disconnection for just those dates?""

""Yes sir, no problem. I will do that for you now.""

""Okay, so not from today, but for these dates, right?""

""Yes, not a problem. Scheduling that for you n.....""

""Hello? Hello?""

He had disconnected my service immediately. I was working on a plant site 2 hours from the nearest town. By the time I got to a landline, I was less than happy. ~~This is the highest concentration of stupidity I've found on this sub in a while.

Sure you've got people who don't want to internet or forget things are plugged in but... this. I'm struggling to formulate a correct reaction. It's like my brain is stuck in a superposition of rage, laughter, incredulity, and pity.

Oh well, I'm sure something stupider will turn up soon enough.

Great story, OP.~~Someone left a phone at my old job, the iPhone 8 I think. It was new at the time. My manager decided he wanted to sell it, so he v wrapped it in foil and stuck it in the walkin. Most scummy thing I've seen him do if a long list. ~~",The commenter shares a personal experience of dealing with a colleague who lied on his credit card and overdraft application.

6.0,"&gt; Now the retail stores are so predatory, that they will do anything for a sale

I used to work for a cell company as well, and every time a sales person did something unscrupulous to make a sale, I wanted to drive to the store, grab the offending rep by the collar, and yell, ""If they BRING IT BACK, you DON'T GET CREDIT FOR THE SALE, you giant goob!""

I never did as I needed to keep my job...  but I wanted to.~~One of my coworkers had a merchant that called in saying that their credit card terminal isnt powering on. The night before it was not connecting to the internet and they thought it was the terminal (it was their internet) and proceeded to take it apart then put it back together and did not think to call us before hand. They really were not happy when they had to fork out $300 for a new machine because theirs was outside of warranty~~Worked for Nextel in retention for around 5 years.  Dealers were shady AF.  Our retention department got shady AF, too, after the Sprint merger.  Under Nextel we were greenlit to just about anything to keep a customer, Sprint tightened down on what we were allowed to credit or discount so everyone started lying to make their bonus numbers.~~What is your name?

May I have your mobile number?

Have you backed up your contacts? 

COMPLETELY RACIST!!!

If I had of been an American sounding customer you wouldn't have even asked me these questions. You would have just verified by caller ID, WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE, assumed the rest and updated my sim cards. Alas you are a racist. You are purposely asking so-called procedural questions to waste my time and discourage me from calling in again. 

Normal protocol?
More like racist protocol! 

/s~~Oh man. I used to work for the company that made those phones. More than a few times have I spent 20 minutes trying to tell someone to push the home button on the ipad/iphone. They could not figure it out. ""the only button on the face of the device"", ""the round button at the bottom"", ""it has a white square"", ""it is indented"", ""the button you would press to get back to the main screen"". I realized some people hold their ipads sideways or upsidedown.~~I HATE that. It's always your fault even when it isn't your fault. My co-worker took five calls from the same guy yesterday, wrong number every time, from a guy who was dead set on the idea that he was calling his apartment supervisor and she was just trying to mess with his head by telling him he was talking to the answering service for a tree trimming company.~~If I got a free phone replacement, the last thing I'd be concerned with is the color.  JFC dude, get a case and get over it.

Entitled people are just slightly underneath the screamers when it comes to call center stress.  No, you don't deserve special treatment you dumb shit.  GTFO.

I think my problem in this job is I have no patience for assholes.~~God #3 reminds me of someone I know in real life. He shouted at the call rep for ""eating steak and caviar on my dime"" when they called him to say they were gonna shut off his phone soon. Asked him how much he'd paid them since he'd signed the contract with the phone company. Nothing. He had paid $0 to this company. And he'd bought the phone on one of those $0 contracts, so the phone company hadn't gotten any money out of him in the 6 months since he'd signed on.~~&gt; The sad in this story is that as mostly all customers in this company have the same mindset this is not one call out of a hundred. this is all the time. 

That's because once a new bill period starts then everything goes back to zero!

And no give-backs!!!!~~I can't stand when this happens. Recently we had a system change which means we can't run our orders until the accounts are up-to-date.
Of course customers think they can pay through online banking and it'll all be resolved within 5minutes.
We then have to tell them we need the payment to clear on our end which can take 1-2 business days. They then offer to give us confirmation of the payment, which doesn't help us process the payment any faster.
They still have to wait....~~I am so happy to pay under $200 for 3 lines, including an XR and S10e both with insurance.  The only bad part is my daughters phone isnt covered or anything (it is my old iPhone 7 that I bought out of pocket), so if something happens to it, shes SOL.~~Oh man. 

I work in a retail store for the same company. 

It still baffles me that customers think they can just yell at us and get their way, or use the Ive been a customer line and get what they want. 

Youre doing great, keep up the good work.~~I was always baffled by people who threatened to take their service elsewhere. Like, mate, what makes you think my minimum wage ass gives a shit???? Youre calling up &amp; bitching me out - Id personally prefer you go elsewhere so myself &amp; my collages never have to deal with your shit again. 

Call Center employees dont own the company, you taking your services elsewhere is something we all give absolutely ZERO f*cks about and its beyond me why youd think that threat is ever going to work on a wage slave.~~Used to work for a big mobile company in the UK until a couple months ago and we didn't get this type of person particularly often (even in retentions) but my God they just blow your mind. Like how can someone actually be so dense? 

They'd always threaten to not pay their bill so smugly as if we'd just be like 'actually you know what, we didn't think of that - fair enough here's a free phone'. I'd usually just respond with ""Well I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you want to tank your credit score"" and it usually shut them up. I had one guy once say to me ""well I don't care about that I don't need a good credit score because I've already got a mortgage"" ~~My technique is to go really quite on them, give them a huge breath after they say a paragraph until they start going ""Hello?"" and then re-repeat whatever I am trying to tell them as clearly as possible and even interrupt as a I finish what I'm going to say. Works great and doesn't come across as bad service to the user it just reminds them that they are wasting their own time.~~",The commenter used to work for a retail store and had a bad experience with a customer who didn't want to pay for a new credit card terminal because it was outside of warranty.

7.0,"You should bypass that absolutely incompetent manager and go straight to HR, and definitely start logging every instance of harassment; dates, times, descriptions and person(s) involved (if you know who they were). 

While youre at it, if youre looking for advice on moving forward, I suggest posting this on r/legaladvice or r/legaladviceuk - depending on location of course.~~90% of the companies, call centers or no, don't care about you as an employee. We no longer live in an IBM/Xerox world where once you had a job you had a job for life. Any monkey can be trained to work at a call center. The worst three years of my life were at a call center. 

&gt;Manager: I see your shift is almost over. A little bird told me you wanted overtime.   
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Ohhhhh, it's so wrong about that!  
&gt;  
&gt;Manager: You know that you're expected to work over time, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well, I was hired for 40hrs/wk. Are you saying overtime is mandatory?  
&gt;  
&gt;Manager: Well, it's not mandatory but it ***is*** required. 

That's when I started looking for a new job.~~Inbound is easier in my opinion because people call in to resolve something when they have time to resolve it whereas outbound they may think youre a scam or have no time or may not be aware of whatever needs resolved.

If you have that much grief over your current job, switch. Change something and see how you like it. If its also terrible, look into other opportunities. But a bad situation wont get better by being miserable.~~You have everything you need, since you moved back home.  

What you *don't* need is a job that makes you feel mentally unstable.  If you continue going there, and it pushes you over the edge...the recovery is not fun, trust me.  Neither is that plunge down the hill in the first place.

Its not worth it, if you don't *have* to go.~~When we used to pull pranks in our office it was things like, swapping around everyone's nameplates on their cubicles, or waiting until they left their computer unlocked and walked off and sending silly emails to other people.

This isn't harmless fun, I'd have gone to HR the first time my personal property was stolen and returned damaged and the manager didn't seem to give a shit.

Take all personal property home and don't bring in anything that isn't 100% necessary to do your job, and in the meantime, start looking for a new job. HR at this company might not care, and that's something you need to be prepared for.~~Surveys are such a ""pass the buck"" nonsense.  It's a way for the company to say, ""it's not our POLICIES that need to be changed, it's the REPS who just can't EXPLAIN it correctly.""  My bank is moving to AI ""surveys"" soon which just judge based on empathy phrases and such and frankly I'm looking forward to it because if I do what I'm supposed to then the customer is irrelevant.~~Talk to your doctor, try and get some mental health treatment. Medication, therapy, whatever your doctor thinks is best for you.

On the job front, are you looking for a totally different job or other call centre work? I only ask because a different call centre might be easier to get and you could move into a less ""critical"" field. House insurance is quite low pressure, mostly just amiable chats with people about their valuables.~~Take your vacation time. It's super important. That time off can help a lot with these types of feelings. Burnout in these types of work environments is extremely real. Make sure you do things outside of work that you love. Go on dates with your significant other. Find an outlet for the emotions of work. Working out, writing, painting, anything.~~I worked at a call center for 3 years and one day one of my coworkers collapsed at his desk and had to be taken out by ambulance. He ended up recovering, but nobody even batted an eye during the whole thing. Its absolutely insane how toxic and dehumanizing of an environment it is. 

Im glad youre getting out and I wish you the best of luck.~~Fight for that raise. My job did the same to me, promoted a bunch of us to ""Subject matter expert,"" which here apparently just means an unpaid supervisor. 

Expected us to take supervisor calls and put out fires all day with no extra compensation. Our compensation was ""not having to take phone calls all day."" But I would rather service normal calls than get yelled at all day sooo....

I went to three managers before I found someone who agreed that that was BS, and that more responsibility should equal more pay. Ended up getting an entire job grade raise for all of us which included extra vacation time and a higher minimum salary. 

You just gotta make yourself heard.~~Document, document document.  Dates, times and persons involved.  Take photos or videos of the damage to your items.  This goes beyond fun and games and at least in the USA would qualify as harassment and a hostile work environment. Then go to your HR department if you have one.

Also check and see if your call center has cameras on the floor.  I know mine does. Video recordings might help identify the culprits.~~that my friend is burnout. I recognize how preachy Im gonna sound, but I recommend meditation and a stuffed animal on your desk. Its not gonna make the job suck less (I know from experience) but it really does help figure out how to control the lines between work and home. Stuffed animals for me function a reminder that not everything is so damn world ending all the time, no matter if the caller THINKS it is.~~&gt;"" Ive called in before and was always able to get information Do I need to call my lawyer?

""Ma'am, as you are a third party and do not have account with us, no one here can talk to you.  As you are not a customer and I have actual customers to help, I will be ending this call now.""  Click.

I used the above and my Supervisor heard me.  She immediately listened to the call and said I did nothing wrong.  In fact she was surprised I was not meaner in my response. or had not done it sooner.~~1 month notice for a crappy call center? You can just stop showing up if you have another job lined up. When I got out, I put in 2 weeks notice, I lasted half of it. A particularly bad customer ticked all the boxes on that one call and I just hung up on them and logged out of the system, permanently.~~The hardest skill to learn working at a call center is leaving your soul at the door.  You have to harden your heart and not care about whatever the customers issue is.   All while appearing to care. and you have to let what they say about you go in one ear and out the other.  To not take what they say personally.  many do not, or are unable to, learn it and have to go work somewhere else.

basically you have to become almost Sociopathic.~~First off, congrats on sobriety and please keep up the great work. Second of all, is it possible that by getting sober youve opened yourself up to new types of anxiety? I do know that within the first 3 months turnover at call centers are high because even if its easy work being a call center agent is by no means easy. Its tough not knowing what kind of situation you are going into.  I cant say for certain if you will be able to jump over this hurdle but please always put your mental health first and foremost because youve come so far! I wish you all the luck in the world. 

Edited: spelling, autocorrect made my put into out~~I used to work for a bank call center taking inbound calls. I liked it at first, then the company went to shit. But there was a point for about a week we were doing outbound calls and I HATED it. It was so terrible. I received so much more abuse making outbound. Yes inbound has its fair share of abuse but I was way happier doing inbound. Id say if youre that unhappy then switch.~~The job was destroying your life.

You made the right decision to end the job, rather then your life.  


I walked away from a call center nearly 20 years ago.   I still twitch when I hear a phone ring.  


I've never gone back.   At interviews I ask ""Is this position customer facing, in person or via phone?   If so, then I'm not a good fit.""~~When I worked at a banking call center doing card fraud I had a Xanax prescription. Granted it was very small, and allowed me to not be an anxious wreck but still work, but still. 

These days I'm not averse to having a drink while working from home. While I primarily work emails now, it makes the phone time I do have that much more bearable.~~I made it a policy to never apologize to them because it wasnt my fault, and Im not responsible for the unfair rules of the company.  I also decided that if they were really yelling at me or overstepping boundaries, Id disconnect the call.  I would pretend it was an accident on their end.  These were two things I did for my own sanity because otherwise I would feel how you do.  Try to create some rules that work for you.  Dont take it personally because you dont make the rules at the job.~~Im so sorry youre dealing with this. I just want to warn you that if you quit right after maternity leave some companies have a policy that you must return to work or your leave wasnt valid and theyll ask for it to be paid back. Id check your handbook really closely so you know that you have to work a 1/2 day then quit rather than just never return.~~You should get advice from someone that is qualified but in the UK there is a legal concept called constructive dismissal. This is where if you are treated so badly that you are forced to resign it is the same as if you were sacked without due cause.

I would also see your doctor and get something on record saying you do not have anger issues but are showing signs of stress from a poor working environment. Depending on your contract (hopefully permanent now so you are entitled to sick leave) you may be able to get signed off work to help you job hunt.~~I generally only lurk in this sub as I've never worked at a call-center. However, I do know what it's like to have a job make you suicidal. No job is worth your life. No job is **ever** worth your life.

Furthermore, this panic that you're feeling right now is also super normal and not at all an indication that you made the wrong choice. These next few weeks/months will be hard, especially as you start job hunting which is filled with rejection. The good news is that there will be another job. This next job could be your dream job. Or not, in which case you can keep looking. You may have to take a pay cut, but you are worth being happy. You are worth having a job that you don't dread going to everyday.

As others have said, document everything and speak to HR straight away to start a case. 

Also if the culture is that toxic, Id start looking for a new job. You may win the battle but the culture may not change.~~A place I worked at had a similar situation to your OP
A guy I had known and worked with, did quite well and worked as hard as he could and sometimes even do a shift swap with you.
I remember saying I will see them after a weekend. They had died over that weekend. The management took us in a group at at time, told us gave less then a few minutes to process before it was back on the phones. 
We were told about his funeral and where given info if we wanted to attend, but we're told it would be as ""unpaid leave""
Sadly he wasn't the only coworker there I knew well who passed away.

Good for you OP your life and wellbeing is worth far more that a paycheck 
Condolences for your coworker~~So thats one of the problems will call centers. It seems to bring out these issues in people. 

Unfortunately Im permanently damaged by depression. I ended up quitting and working at another call center, but since its not sales, Im not being rejected constantly. I would do what you can to start looking for a different job

In the mean time, see your doctor, get diagnoses for anxiety, use FMLA to take time off work while searching for a new job.~~So much easier and so much better!  I only worked outbound for a short period of time, but it was soul destroying work and I will never do it again.

Ive worked inbound for more than a decade and its much better.  Although you still deal with some degree of angry customers, the difference for me is that, no matter how angry they might be, they called you and they want to talk to you and have your help.

Interspersed among the anger and nonsense, sometimes youre able to legitimately help people and they express their gratitude.  With all the vernal abuse most of us cs reps get, those good calls can really help make a difference in being able to keep positive.

If you have the option to switch to inbound, I would do so in a heartbeat.~~Here's what got me through, I just kept myself in ""autopilot/zombie"" mode all the time and all of my responses were very generic.
I worked for a call center to a big (and widely hated) telecommunication company years ago and non of the customers were nice, probably one nice person every couple of weeks.

I basically thought of the phone calls as ""not real"" due to my excessive use of already written replies and lines, and that no matter what happens in the end of the call, nothing bad is going to happen to me. Yes they're rude and angry, but they can't do anything to me because I'm over the phone and I can either finish the call quickly or drag it on and waste their time. As long as I stick to my generic replies, I would clock out in 8 hours with nothing to worry about.
Edit: thank you for the F kind stranger~~So much!  I feel like our (at my center anyway) supervisors should have to have one day a month where they take calls. The same kind of calls we take, and just get to go into 3 hour meetings and leave us with no support then question why part of our survey numbers are down.~~Working in a call center is like prison, you are doing time even if you are innocent.

I know money is important, but if you totally lose it, your problems will be bigger.

Good luck.~~No job is worth making you feel like that. I got out of call centre work a few years ago because I was going through a similar thing. Constant anxiety, poor general health, crying before and after each shift, migraines - I had the lot.

Time for you to recover &amp; find something else.~~Yep, working a call centre job literally broke me.  Got to the point that I'd get the shakes on the bus to work and have to get off 2/3 of the way in and go back home.  If I made it in, then I'd last maybe 20 minutes.  Eventually, unsurprisingly they found me unfit to work.   

Needless to say they lied to me and gave me next to no support.  Fuck Australia Post.~~When I worked in a CC a looooong time ago,   
I was told by management my CSAT scores were low.  
I noticed the comments were slagging the company off, not me. They didn't care though obviously. Gave me the general NPC ""Coaching"" which wasn't needed.  


During the next few weeks I was saying ""After this call, you may receive a survey. The survey reflects upon our conversation today &amp; how happy you are with me as an agent, not the company or wider organisation"".  


My score went from red to green &amp; I was getting a nice bonus.  
I was then pulled in and told to stop saying this, as it was ""manipulating"" my scores.  
Bruhhhhhh~~You know your body and mind, if you need rest and you have the ability to take it without negatively impacting your career stability, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. Customer service is emotional labor which can be much more difficult than physical labor, you deserve and need to take breaks to allow your mind to heal just as you would need to allow your body to heal with a manual labor job. There is no prize in pushing yourself to the point of breaking~~Yeah, it sucks sometimes. I have run/stormed/slinked off to the bathroom to lock myself in a cubicle and cry for a bit. I did 6 months without a day off and that broke me. The last few months especially were awful. I've had a week off since then and feel way better now. I think it's a little different for me because my contract ends in October (and if I can help it, I won't be renewing) so I can see the finish line.

Good things about my job:

* I like every single person in my team

* My managers have been great

Bad things:

* The customers. I hate them.

Point is, you're definitely not the only one to feel that way.~~I can relate. I have this bleak theory that call centers wear their employees down by default and create anxiety problems like you've described. When ""listening"" to my irate customers, I catch myself daydreaming about happier jobs like roadkill cleanup, grave digger, septic tank technician, garbage man (the list goes on). Anyway. This job isn't worth your physical and mental health and I hope you can get out, even if it's a pay cut. I work at a car dealership call center and it is a similar (but much trashier) slice of Hell. Hang in there, champ.~~I have not worked in a call center in a year and a half and STILL hate speaking on the phone. To anyone.  Put up with the bullshit metrics and being an adult told how long im allowed to pee in 8 hrs just drove me infuckingsane! Perhaps if a call center used the supervisors to actually help a customer instead of them listening to catch a minor ""infraction"" by a burnt out rep. I just can't believe how a shitty job got shit e r. Crs is the usual contact and face of your penny pinching ass. Treat them how you want them to represent your company.  Wheew I feel better ~~I worked a call center job for a great deal of last year, I never understood what people meant by it being a ""soul sucking job"" since it was just talking on the phone. I no call-no showed on my last scheduled day before I quit and ignoring calls from my boss while playing Xbox for 8 hours straight was the best way I could've spent that last day~~In addition to what others have said here, you might want to speak with a counselor as well.  And definitely be open with your partner about this.  Otherwise, it might mean the end of your relationship.

I went through a period like this as well, but I made sure to tell my wife what was going on because I didn't want her to be worried at my strange behavior.  Luckily for me, a position in a different department opened up, which I then got hired for, then I changed my unhealthy eating habits and started exercising more.  That's made all the difference in the world.

Hang in there.  I hope you find another less mentally draining job soon.~~Call centers are an existential grind that represents the worst of the modern advances in technology.      

I bought something, but I need help with it. Can I talk to a person, live, at any time? Great!        

That person is a robot. Not like a beep-boop robot, more like where the term ""robot"" was defined, from the Czech word *robota*, meaning *forced labor*. If you're a phone drone, you are tracked to the microsecond. Average handle time, issue resolution, ""friendliness,"" after call work (in case you can't devote your full attention to the customer *and* wrangle some janky CRM system simultaneously, aka two jobs); it's all metrics and KPIs designed to turn you into a meat AI.       

It's ""how to extract the most value from your mind as possible"" in practice, and it's disgusting and degrading.        

//rant over~~Just about any job will replace you within a week or two, maybe as long as a month.  And no matter how you left (fired/quit/deceased) the blame on anything that's messed up will fall on you for a few months.  A company is not a feeling entity and while some co-workers care about you as a human, many don't and neither does the company.  It's not long before the question is posed ""Bob who? Oh was he the guy working in X dept before?  I think I heard something about him"".  And shortly after that......nada, there isn't even a memory of you.  

You can't have your job/career define who you are, because you mean little to nothing to the company.  I'm glad you're moving on, but keep the experience in mind and remember to put yourself first.~~talking about things and finding hobbies is self therapy. finding time or contacting chat lines is worth it if you can. glad you found something that helps and have good support. please consider thanking her by going with her a few times. you both spent years in this situation and it will have a lasting impact. if it really does not help or causes problems sorry but you won't lose anything out by trying when you feel ready.~~One month, when I had the lowest survey scores I'd ever had, not one, but TWO of my surveys were for other departments entirely. One even gave the first and last name of the *MAN* (I'm female with a squeaky voice) they had a complaint against.

Guess who got a pay cut for that.~~","The commenter sympathizes with the OP's situation and suggests documenting everything and speaking to HR immediately if the culture is toxic.

7.0,"Yes, I hit my breaking point. Turns out getting written up because I followed the rules, all because a customer did a survey and gave me a bad review simply because they weren't actually an authorized user on the account. Wound up going on break and having a break down, chain smoking a few cigarettes after being clean for a few months and going back in, having my boss ask what's up and telling him I quit.

Take deep breaths, find something you enjoy doing with your free time, when an angry customer comes on the line lower their volume and lower yours, find your center. Separate work from out of work and realize, that this person isn't pissed at you but at your company because of a rule they feel is arbitrarily made to fuck them over (which usually it isn't). ~~My first job after years of call center hell (logistics analyst), I was just like Red in Shawshank after being released.   


I was going to be late for work one day (my car wasn't starting, luckily I lived about a mile away) so I sprinted. Got there about 8:07 sweaty and apologizing. They're like, dude, don't do that, just get here as soon as you can.  


Told my supervisor I was going to the bathroom real fast. ""Dude, I don't care.""  


It took me about a month to get used to being treated like an adult. No 15 minute break to get to the bathroom 9 minutes away, no dings if you were a minute late back from lunch. FUCK ADHERENCE and everything it stands for.  


Congrats on the escape!~~I just called of sick today. Probably going to either get a warning to terminated .woke up with a horrible migraine exhausted mentally drained 

We have been massively overworked due to low staff and high call volume . I asked my temp manager about sick days they said if I get a warning or not should. Ot effect the way I feel . The sarkyness of the way they spoke to me today was the last straw so I took the day .

Don't care tbh if they sack me jobs not worth it~~I've been working customer service for over a decade now and I truly understand how you feel, just  the thought that I would have to go back to work would cause physical pain, I got fired and got into another company where I was able to move up the ladder and promised myself that I would ensure none of the people that works with me has to go through that and I believe I have been able to keep my promise. Sorry to make this about myself but my point is that you are not weak nor alone in this and that sometimes this industry can cause unnecessary problem to their workers especially due to people lacking empathy towards others...am happy for you that you put your mental, emotional and physical health above work, I do hope you find a better place of work where you can achieve your goals.~~I quit my job after 20 years and made over 27 bucks an hour. Overtime was usually available and got a yearly bonus the last 2 years. 

Had health insurance and 31 days of PTO. 

I just couldnt do it anymore, luckily I was able to financially prepare for it. I make a lot less (but do have great benefits) and have no regrets. 

I had no idea how much anxiety that job caused, I knew it was stressful but definitely underestimated how much it affected me. 

I still have to calm my self down and tell myself to breathe, I think I held my breathe for that 20 years.~~Do not feel guilty for taking mental health day. Taking paid leave shouldn't require any explanation. It's your day, your choice.

There isn't really a trick to get through a shift. Just steps to take to prevent a bad day like - getting a full night's sleep, drink water, take your breaks when appropriate.

Does talking to strangers emotionally exhaust you? You may seriously want to consider a different line of work if that's the case. I thrive on consulting my callers, and I intend to work in telecommunication the rest of my career. But it's different for everyone.~~Earlier this year I left a position at a cable company that was paying me very little and sad benefits for a position at an insurance company with highly competitive pay and great benefits. I still deal with crappy customers sometimes but the pay makes it easier to deal with. However today, I had a call that really got on my nerves.  It was the roommate of the customer trying to communicate with me while the customer rage-shouted obscenities in the background and the mother of the customer in the background kept referring to me as ""the idiot"". It seems almost every day I am surprised by how some people conduct themselves.~~UK manager here, 

You definitely need to get HR involved, professionally and via email. Go over your managers head and get the email CCd with their managers email and one above. Three months of bullying, malice damage and assault are no things a company ever wants to be associated with encouraging.
Also find your employee handbook. There should be a whole section dedicated to situations dish as yours.~~I felt the same way working for a call center for a bank and so did most of my coworkers. Banking just sucks the life out of you. Best advice I can give you is to take a vacation day every few weeks if you're able and use vto if that's an option.~~I wouldnt be concerned. Even with your first and last name, that isnt enough to find you. He doesnt have your address, not even a photo to find you on Facebook, linked in etc. Where I work the company would call the police if I raised it as a concern. As a colleague of mine once said to a customer who threatened them you dont know my details but I know yours and where to send the police - never had an issue with that customer again. Plus we would close their account, sorry your employer doesnt back you up on this.~~The further down the ladder you are, the less they care. I worked in a call center as well and one 10+ year employee died from cancer. All they sent was an email and offered grief counseling.

However, one of the sites department leaders died because they drove a motorcycle drunk on a backroad at 2 am and crashed. Site leadership closed the call center the next day to show respect when in actuality they were forcing everyone to acknowledge the stupid death of one of their buddies.~~&gt; I wonder frequently if its illegal to require us to study outside of work on our free time.

Uh, yep. The benefit is theirs, the requirement is for their benefit, and I bet it's no use to you elsewhere.

If you're on a salary, that can be part of duties, but if you're hourly, it's illegal in most civilized places.~~I worked at a telecommunications company that outsourced their calls to us and every week there was an ambulance in front of the building because someone had passed out from taking calls

From talking telephone calls in a comfy chair in an air conditioned building...a job that in theory ought to be easy as pie and yet it's one of the most stressful jobs imaginable

Because of the rules in place on what we can and cannot say to the callers no matter how abusive they may be to us

BTW You probably have stories about jerks while working at the call center...share them here...it will help alleviate a lot of the bad feelings you've been going through

Good luck on your other job~~It really really brought out my submissive side in more way than one. I will no longer travel to:Florida,Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Ohio, Oregon, New Jersey, Rhode Island or Maryland. I HATE calling people on the phone now.  I did gain the ability to de-escalate situations and it helped me to be able to let someone sit and scream at me and I'm not affected.  ~~I'm so glad you posted this because I constantly feel like I'm a crazy person because my coworkers seem so nonchalant about working here. I've been in this same job for 7 damn years and I've cried in the bathroom, thrown up from anxiety, called out because I just couldn't do it that day and more. I look for new jobs but they pay less or have worse benefits so I feel stuck. I want to go back to school, but I'm still paying off a student loan. I know this probably wasn't very helpful to you, but please know you're not alone~~My last two jobs were phone tech support/billing. My depression worsened and I was having constant meltdowns and even ptsd from when the BING of a call would come in. Id get sweaty and my stomach would hurt for a moment. It really is one of the worst jobs ever.~~Hits very close to home. Lifting weights too, no meditation but have thought of it.  
After 7months I quit for various reasons; increased work for same pay, not caring for employees, life was dull. 
   
Now after a month out of the job, I realise I have postponed and neglected a lot of social time with (at that time -to be new-) friends because all this time I would have been too tired after work from people nagging all day. It felt good to come home and be alone, or just be with the regular old friendgroup.
  
But all my ""regular"" friends and acquaintances have 'moved on'.
It's like the time on the phone -being 'social' to customers- depletes your reservoir of 'daily social interactions needs'. Yet you don't gain anything.
~~What's your degree in?  
Was the arrest for drugs? If so, do you still do them?  
Are you on behavior meds? If so, how well do they keep you under control?  
My buddy is bi polar, graduated top of his class from a very good business school and struggles to achieve anything. Currently he is in a mental ward because they kept prescribing new drugs and the interactions were not doing him any good. He's on disability now, but that did not solve anything except give him some money to live on. He really needs something to get wrapped up in and quit sitting around dwelling on the situation.  
Call centers can be a good stepping stone to a lot of other things. Most motivated people on our help desk get moved up into advanced support and even dev jobs depending on their skills.~~Im 50 times more understanding of call centers I call in for my own personal problems . I try to cause as little waves as possible because I know they already have it hard. Even when Im upset, I let the rep know Im upset at the situation and not them personally.~~As part of your recovery you seem to have become able to access feelings that were previously suppressed *even though you weren't abusing drugs at the time*. And I think everyone who has ever worked in a call center has experienced the feeling of being ground down over time. If you have a therapist I strongly hope you get the opportunity to discuss this.~~","The commenter had a bad experience with a customer who gave them a bad review because they didn't have an authorized user on the account. They had to go on break and smoke a few cigarettes after being clean for a few months, and had to deal with being treated like an adult. They"
7.0,"No job is worth your mental health. Quitting my first call center job was the best decision I ever made. That being said, some call centers are better than others. If you can find a call center job that has ""happier callers"" (for example maybe customer service instead of collections or insurance) also if you can find a call center that offers more than the traditional 2 weeks vacation, it will help a lot. People weren't built to sit at a computer all day taking verbal abuse, its completely understandable that it would be a lot to handle. Best of luck to you!~~Hubby just quit his cooking job (from ages 16-44 he worked kitchens) to work as a healthcare worker. I'm really proud of him for doing something about the depression he is in. 

I'm sorry you feel you have to quit but may the world bless you with a job you love!~~There is something more important than money.

You have to spend a lot of time at work.  If work is hell, then no amount of money can fix that.

Ive taken a pay cut to get out of a bad situation.  I didnt regret it.  I doubt you will regret this either.~~Glad to hear you got out. I seem stuck in a revolving door of call center hell, got out went to school and the only job I could find right after school was a call center. Worked there and then ended up at another call center, then unemployed for several months to another CC job (though this one was government and easy) worked that for a year, then unemployed and just recently got a job that's WFH but it's another call center. I've had some other jobs like factory work and some retail but in my area the job market just plain sucks.   


Fuck call centers, I'm so close to just walking away and just running out my unemployment instead of this bullshit. I'm glad some are seeing light at the end of the tunnel.~~A long time ago I worked at a call center. We would drink on the  job all the time. Water cooler was next to a fridge full of beer. Floor boss was often  absent. Smile and dial. You now what sales culture can be like. Was like hanging out at a frat house.~~Call centres will pay you enough money to keep you reasonably happy and financially secure, but that's all. You sit down and listen to and deal with enough bullshit to be able to come home, sit down and watch Netflix, eat, have a few drinks or cigarettes- all perfectly financially attainable in your current wage- and zone out until you need to get back to work. Any higher wage, and you might be able to save enough to get out. Any fewer hours than full time and you might have the time to study or develop a different kind of expertise or trade enough to get out. Why would your employers want you to do that?

You're contemplating leaving. I know it's not a way up, but it is a way out. Most call centres offer neither. If you can advance within the company, it's only as an asset to themselves.~~That sounds rough. From personal experience I know how much it can chip away at you. Get out as soon as you can, they clearly don't care about the high turnover and are quite happy to drive staff into the ground. The only advice I would give is don't leave until you have 100% got your next job lined up.  Don't look at being at home with the folks or no debt as a safety net, in this current climate its best to have as much savings as you can to fall back on. All the best and good luck!~~Congratulations! I know the feeling. My husband and I had recently moved (at the time, 6 years ago now) and I got a job at a call center (work I had done before with no issues). I went through training fine. But the day I was supposed to go live on the phones, I had a panic attack in my car before I even left home. Had to call my husband to come help me out of the car. I called my supervisor (who I hadn't even met) to tell them I quit. He said ""ok"" and hung up. Best decision ever.~~I spent 14 years in a call center. I have seen far too many colleagues pass, some just disappeared. Occasionally there would be an email notice that someone had died and then silence....

In my last two years there, I had 4 bouts of acute pancteatitis that almost took me out. The following year I had heart attacks, Dr best guess was over 100 in a 2 1/2 week period. That is when I decided I had to get out.

No, they companies don't give one shit about anybody in  their employ. They justvwant to wringveveryvlast penny they can from you without spending that penny on you. There are farctoo many people out there looking for work so they can punt you off and get the next subservient slave.

Worse is the fact that it is going to get one fuck of a lot worse and I really don't see an end to it. 

Can anybody see a positive side to it?~~Im gonna be honest with you here. Unless you need this job back after your mat leave, just GIVE UP lol. Seriously, they cant fire you now, being pregnant, that would be an HR nightmare for them.  Stop giving a fuck about this job.


Under normal circumstances I would say if your job is making you miserable on your days off, the ship has sailed and you need to leave. I know right now, you cant. But that doesnt mean you have to keep giving them such a big part of yourself every day. Do the bare minimum. What are they gonna do, fire you? They cant.~~The only thing that keeps me going is that I need paychecks until I can get paychecks from a different employer. I'm so done with this call center experience. I'm talking myself into going to work everyday. I have to work in a basement and I get little sunlight every day. I'm getting to the point I'd rather have a minimum wage job stocking shelves and dealing with the random rude customer than having to sit at a desk in a basement and answering one call right after the other. I'm so sick and tired of being someone's dumping ground because they are in a foul mood.

So, TL;DR: I feel you.~~Inbound is way easier. In a way, it puts you in the position of the expert. People are calling you, asking for your help/opinion/service expertise. I also think it's more comfortable talking to people who call me than the other way around. And depending on where you work it can be a pretty good gig.~~My call center job is destroying my life as well and I'm not as strong as you are to quit, You made the right choice, no money is worth of what a stressful job can do in your life.

The only reason why I keep my job despite what it does to me is because I have a wife and a son that depend on me and I live in third world country where job opportunities are so low that call centers end up being the only solution to avoid starving.

So keep on my friend, is not over, is just the beggining of something else, something better hopefully.~~If she's buddy-buddy with her boss, I would recommend going to HR if your company has an hr department.  I would be prepared with any evidence you can gather, emails, texts, perhaps even asking a coworker who knows about the situation to provide a statement.  Nobody should have to dread going into work because of your boss.  If HR isn't an option, and your boss's boss isn't an option, go to that persons boss.  If your workplace has a union, they may be able to help you out, although this may require you be a member.  I wish the best, and hope everything works out for you.~~Call center work is the only employment I've had that has had so many side effects. I take a bubble bath and get high after work pretty often to try to calm down. Sometimes I'm still too angry, and I'll aggressively clean my house while shaking and fuming. Everyone says, ""you have to shake it off, let it roll off of you, "" but sometimes you just can't. 

 I have bad depression, anxiety, especially social anxiety. I constantly feel like I'm about to break down. I get shaky and angry and blink back tears all day. 

It's amazing what such a stupid job can do. Answering phones shouldn't give me PTSD. I'm not a fucking fire fighter.  But people are so cruel. ~~I've found that the best thing to do at that point is to remind them that you are, in fact, a human being with feelings. And that yelling isn't going to get their problem solved any faster, it's actually slowing the process down. You'd be surprised at how many people will respond to those two things. Use the former on the more ""feelings"" type people, and the latter on the ""all business"" type. It's not 100%, but it's worked for me on a lot of raging customers. ~~I feel your pain... I have severe social anxiety and having people rant at me is very hard. Which I why I'd never do health insurance again. People get understandly angry about health insurance. That was one of my worst jobs supporting a health insurance provider. Now I work from home (because its hard for me to be boxed in with other people) and I support a car insurance company.. surprisingly I'm almost at 3 years and while the job is hard because people get angry when something is out of their control. A supervisor taught me something when I was having a meltdown...she told me insurance is what it is...We can't change the rates, the premium, or anything like that... We can educate the customer and move on... And that's what I do...when they start ranting and raving I put them on mute and light a cigarette. When they are done I confirm what I can, ask if they need anything else and keep it moving.  ~~Start looking for a new Job immediately. I was stuck in a similar situation for 5 years to the point where I got suicidal. Got a New Job recently after starting to go to therapy and I couldn't be more happy. No amount of money is worth making yourself sick. And yes, mental health counts!~~Yes! The worst sound in the world this that 'ding' of an incoming call lol. My first call center job was for a cable company, and the calls were brutal. I got screamed at - a lot. 

My advice, get a few years in at an inbound call center and then you will be able to easily get a better call center job somewhere else. I did 5 years at the cable company, and with that on my resume I was able to get a nice call center job for a non-profit. The calls are pretty much all happy, all holidays off and no nights or weekends. Hiring managers know that if you can last longer than a year at an inbound call center, you are very hardworking and able to work under stress.~~",The commenter believes that quitting a call center job is the best decision one can make for their mental health. They also mention that they had a bad experience working at a call center and had to take a pay cut to get out of a bad situation. They also express frustration with the job market and
7.0,"I am trying to put a positive spin for you on the fact that they asked you to stay:

You are probably excellent at what you do, as much as you hate it and it drains you. 

I do not work in a call center (I lurk on this sub because I am utterly fascinated with your stories and experiences) but I can tell you from my own experience that no matter how much I may hate whatever Im doing, I excel at it. Its a blessing and a curse. I bet youre the same way. So its a huge loss for them.

But for your sake, Im glad youre getting out. I wish you all the best in your new role!~~I totally feel this. The friend I used to live with even called me out on my lack of empathy. We have to put in so much while working theres none left over for the people we actually care about who deserve it. 

Im currently on short term disability because of the stress from work brought back a debilitating sickness. Sometimes I dont know how much of this is the sickness vs result of stress. Even job searching is so exhausting in this climate its so frustrating. I hope you get one of the other jobs.~~I'm usually a proponent of waiting to leave until you have a new job, but that advice stops when the job is taking a serious mental and physical toll. 


When I quit my call center job I took a pay cut they almost didnt offer me the job because it was a good deal less, but mental health and happiness is worth investing in my dude. 


You might make less, but I guarantee a year from now you won't regret it.~~I've been doing it for 4+ years. Roughly 50% of the time has been chat which isn't nearly as mentally draining, but still.

My job is hourly + commission so I can make some respectable paychecks. I have my own apartment in a pretty expensive city.

I hate every second of taking phone calls, but I feel completely stuck because I don't know how else to make this much money.

I'm doing terrible mentally. One of the perks of my job was I got to meet a bunch of new friends and be social, but ever since covid it's a WFH gig. I am alone and empty. I don't know what to do.

I've been hitting them gym for the past 6 months and I hike and bike a lot so I'm doing great physically, but it doesn't mask the pain in my soul.~~Ive worked as phone agent, QA analyst, and trainer/supervisor across 3 different call centers. The one position I turned down repeatedly was Team Lead. Its a stressful job for only a dollar or two more - and in call centers where the agents have an incentive bonus plan, your checks might even be smaller than before. Call centers know that employees will deal with it to get off the phones full time so upper management doesnt bother to make the position more enticing. Also, the Team Lead path typically ends in a dead end - theres not really room for advancing without leaving the department.

They not only have you doing this job free but are actively refusing to give you a raise. They can eat a giant bag of glitter dusted d**ks. 

Take the day off - hell, take a few - and spend the time with your family - at the end of the day (and the beginning and middle), theyre the important ones.~~Okay...

I've been there.  I had a call center job that made me fantasize about ways I could get killed in a car accident every day on the way there.  Remember though... it's a job.  Those dumb bitches who are whining about skirts and socks aren't worth your life or feeling any kind of pain over.  Can you get a grant to go back to school?  Can you move somewhere with a better job market?  

That's what I did.  I moved to a new city, and the job I've had for the last two years doesn't even involve talking to people.  I don't have a phone on my desk.  It's incredible.  There is always a way out that will keep you on this planet until the stars say it's time for you to go.  ~~I'd document and backdate it as much as you can recall clearly, talk to HR. 
Though I do like the suggestion above to sue for a hostile work environment so maybe go to HR and slip it into conversation, ""My solicitor thinks I have enough to sue for hostile work environment, but that's just a plan B""~~No job is worth your health. I think you just have to decide if you will be worse off chilling out at home for a bit between jobs or stay at a job that is causing you stress. You seem to be in a good position to say sod it and leave without suffering financial hardship.~~I worked at a GMAC call center for several years. Loved it. Got supervisor, still loved it in dealer-buy-outs, Auctions, and Inspections. Then I went to Repossession Customer Service. It was the most horrific experience of my life. I lasted like 3 months, was in such a horrible depression from the awful job of listening to people cry and beg and cuss... my boyfriend (now husband) said you have to quit, I will live in a box if we have to, but I dont think youll survive like this.~~Given what I know about payday lenders, you may want to continue the job hunt even still. Payday lending is, quite frankly, grossly unethical. These loans prey on the vulnerable by offering the tempting prospect of a quick way out of a tough situation, but they aren't so benevolent. It is intended to create a debt cycle in which an individual is constantly in some degree of debt to the payday lender.

Good luck.~~I'm just burnt out on people in general. I need off the phones for a while, maybe online help desk. Coupled with some other life issues and my partner currently being in a mental health crisis I just can't fucking do it anymore. I sit in wrap up and watch the stupid queue rise and don't care. We're always busy. It was never like this before. I'd love some time off, even if it is unpaid, but that'll never happen because we're short staffed. My favorite is when I answer the phone and thank them for interrupting my life because they want something dumb like their email client to be purple.~~Run. Haha. I was in your position a while ago. I got into bank customer service call center work riiiiiight before the '08 recession. My friends and family said I was a completely different person; Much darker and more depressed. I credit that job for giving me thick skin, but it also exposed me to how terrible other human beings are. Folks have teeth when they aren't face to face with you and your bosses care more about getting people to do credit card applications (that they typically get declined for and pisses the already pissed off customer more) than your well-being. 

I made my way into the internal operations side of the bank since I lived near the headquarters, which was a welcome change. Getting away from customers and stupid ""retail banking"" expectations would help if you're able.~~I completely understand you. Ive been in a bank call center wfh since last year and I absolutely hate it. The pay is great but omg this is the most soul draining job Ive ever had. Ive called out so many times that Im now out of pto/sick days and I dont even care. Getting ready to request a leave of absence bc fuck this shit.~~Ive worked through conduent before on a different contract. All honesty the pay is good but youll have to be pretty self reliant if its anything like it is here. The managers and higher ups dont like to help and are often away from their desks. Also theyve had issues asking employees to perform tasks that they arent trained on. 
If you are asked to do a task you arent trained on I suggest you ask your manager for an email with all the details of the task and confirm that they want you to do it even without the proper training, thats just to cover yourself. 

Otherwise its decent, and if you have prior call center experience you shouldnt have many issues.~~The biggest thing is that I don't feel like an adult anymore, and I feel as if I am stupider.

Scheduled potty breaks, sneaking my cell phone to not being caught. When we are only on email work and no phone calls, sneaking out of my chair.

Having to report to managers of lower intelligence levels that me really wore me down. Quite the opposite of inspiring.

I am starting my new job in two weeks and am taking all my vacation days so I can detox and go back to feeling like a grown up. When I went to my interview for the new job, my mindset was, *I am going to interact with this manager as the employee I was before I worked at the call center.*~~I'd spend this time looking for another job. It's affecting your health, and you know that you'll get a load of shit from your managers about taking the time off, making the work environment even more stressful. I knew I was done with call centers when I had a panic attack getting into my car to go to work. I called in and quit that day.~~I know the job sucks... and this subreddit is about people bitching about the customers to vent... 

Seriously, if you are flinching and on meds for it, quit the job and work retail.  For the most part, it's a dead end job so why not move to another dead end job if it is that bad?~~It'll get better. I've worked in call centers for 6 years now, currently working an at home gig for a major insurance company. Sometimes you just need a break, sometimes you need to find a new gig. I've abruptly quit before. Took me only a few days to get a new job. The good thing about call centers, wfh or not, is that they're practically always hiring. ~~I'm so sorry you are going through this. Is there a way for you to leave some sort of discreet camera on your desk (think one of those pen cams or similar) and some ""tempting"" items and step away? It's likely that you may capture footage of the culprit(s) which would help your case with HR. Of course, they may find a way to turn that against you (recording in a secured area without permission, etc.) I don't know, I'm not a lawyer.

With that said, it sounds like you work in a toxic environment and it may be better to try and find a job elsewhere. I realize that this may seem like ""letting them win"" but is staying there worth it?~~I have no experience with a call center type job, but it doesnt sound like a healthy work environment. It is very true that its easier to find another job when you have one, so maybe start looking for another job? You now have some experience you could leverage in looking for another job. I wish you the very best of luck!~~",The commenter sympathizes with the original poster's experience of working in a call center and believes that they are excellent at what they do. They also express frustration with the stress of job searching and suggest that the poster should consider moving to a new department or taking a pay cut if they want to
7.0,"I was in the same boat (but I was only there for 2 months). Although my time was short it was the most miserable Ive been in a very very long time. Ive hung up on probably more than half my calls, i stayed in some sort of auxiliary mode besides ready For long periods of time. I was late lots of times, and as soon as i clocked out, the anxiety of me having to be back the next day kicked in. I couldnt take it. The night before I quit i didnt set my alarm. If i woke up, Id go in another day, if not, well then farewell. And i didnt wake up in time so now Im looking for a new job lol. Id rather worry about finding another job then to have my mental health played with in the name of cUsTomEr sErViCe.~~Feel the freedom. I was forced into call center work when Covid started because there wasn't enough staff - they had one person running my original department so we could all be on the phones. It lasted four months and ended in August when I switched positions. I am still recovering from the long term side effects of extreme anxiety that the job gave me. I will never go near the possibility of that kind of work again.~~Literally walked out of my last call center job for the same reasons. This was like a day after they talked about promoting me (more responsibilities piled on with a $2 raise and benefits). 

When I'm having a hard time at my current job, I just think about that fucking call center. Congratulations.~~I remember one time I got a survey that was great, they liked me and were satisfied. But for the question that said, ""How likely are you to reccomend us to a friend?"" which was the most important question, the customer said 0. Their explanation was, ""I don't have those kinds of conversations with my friends."" 

Which is fair lol because who does, but it tanked that whole survey.~~I'm very blessed in my call center. The customers of course some times scum, but my company gives us spiffs and food and all sorts of stuff because they know the job is hard and they want to keep everyone happy and excited to come to work so they stay rather than cycle out to other companies. 

I have worked in some shit call centers so I get it, but it depends on the company. There are good ones out there.~~Sounds like it's the job. Customer service isn't for everyone. I used to be so patience but after working at my job for 3 years now, I have no patience and pretty sure I have anger issues now. I fully blame my job. 

I'm sorry that you're dealing with this but it sounds like you need to look for a new.~~I feel for you completely.  I worked 10 years in call centers to put myself through college and even now 10 years later,  if I hear a little beep that sounds like an incoming call,  I break out in a cold sweat. It's like PTSD. I used to cry every day in my car before work. Hang in there.~~After training and working a bit, see if you can apply for a position with the actual company that outsources to Conduent. 

Actually do your job. What I mean by this, it a that outsourced vendors like Conduent are paid by the call, so your managers are going to push a churn and burn style, meaning take lots of calls without actually solving customer issues. And then they transfer to senior advisors without even doing the basics. 

Can you tell I deal with Conduent employees in my job (my field is not medical)? My fellow advisors (especially senior ones) and I literally groan when we get a consult or a transferred call from a Conduent advisor. 

I wish you luck. I know the benefits are nice, but its sad how much less youre paid than the corporate employees.~~I may be the singled one out here, and I don't mean to be dismissive, I truly am sorry for your loss. Losing anyone is hard. 

What is it that you want them to do? I think it's kind that they did send an email,  so that those that want to mourn, can. And that they're offering councilor services if it's difficult to process.

Like I said, I don't mean to ask this to be antagonistic.  I'm just interested to know what would have made this situation right for you.~~Yes! For some reason, banking call centers has a nasty habit of destroying your mental health. I use to work at a big bank working as a call center agent. The money and benefits were as amazing you could expect but I was miserable. You have to ask yourself: is the pay &amp; benefits worth your mental health? The answer for me was no so I quit. I miss that job everyday  i manly miss the money. You have to ask yourself he same question. Are the pay and benefits worth your mental health? Once you answer that question, go back to work and stop complaining or start getting your indeed resume out there too look for another job. Good luck. ~~Yup.  I worked for a national ISP and would get serve anxiety on my way to work and while at work.  Anytime my email or teams went off I thought it would be my manager micromanaging me on something (whether it be bathroom breaks, handle time, etc).  I could not take it.  

I left and went to another call center for a medical supply company and it was better but I still had anxiety.  I took off like 6 months FMLA because my mental health deteriorated.  

I finally left call centers for good 5 years ago and am so happy I did.  With my new job I never have anxiety going into work.  I actually love my job!~~after taking calls for 30 years, trying to be helpful, or getting help from someone else for them,  I always cut the line at them swearing at me.  Warn once, hang up on the second offense.  Since I left a company that dealt with the general public 20 years ago, and work with just employees of this company now, life is much better.  The general public can be an ass.  People you see everyday in the elevator are much nicer.~~One of the best things I ever did for myself was quitting the call centre I worked at. The place was absolutely toxic. Every now and then, they would ""cull"" the ""dead weight.""

2 supervisors would go from person to person they were firing, ask them to log-off and go in to the boardroom. A couple minutes later, they would emerge and walk them out. Then, on to the next person. One day, they fired about 30 people in the campaign I worked in. Nobody knew what was happening or how many they were firing, so it was very tense for a few hours.

I swore to myself that I would never work in another call centre, or at least not one that does debt collection. It sucks out all of your happiness and leaves you with an empty husk of a person.~~Ive actually become more outspoken and confident. Before I used to *hate* speaking on the phone or in front of people. Now I just sort of shrug and do it. 

I have also learned to sound way more sure of myself, and I can now confidently say that I dont know an answer.~~So from what you've listed... we've got Harassment, theft, property damage/vandalism, sexual assault, regular assault.

HR is a good start to get the heads rolling. And keep a lawyer in your back pocket in case you get fired. Retaliation is most likely to come from how it sounds these managers are. And i would report both managers for allowing this to happen, in addition to everyone you can genuinely claim was involved.

Edit: Also, Do Not Sign Anything HR Gives You without consulting a lawyer.~~Inbound can be hard -you get people who call in already upset then have to wait on hold and decide they're gonna scream at someone.

But despite that and the 15 seconds to reset your brain after the last person hangs up, I don't think I'd like doing outbound. At the very minimum, it would be stressful to deal with the number of people who don't pick up for important info and you have to notate stuff and send info every other way you can so that they don't come back to scream at you~~Time to develop temporary Tourette's.  It's a condition that affects overworked and under appreciated workers in the last 2 weeks of their employment.  Affected workers have been know to have ticks that cause them to yell things like, ""Fuck You Asshole"", ""Lying Bastard"", ""Dickhead"", ""Eat a Bag of Dicks"", and other things appropriate to the caller but in no way reflective of the lame duck employee.~~Oh I know call centre work all too well. Did and still kinda do IT support for call centres. The totals you guys need. Time per call. Time adherence going on. One of the call centres we support works on a time scale pay for performance basis. Every second counts and they don't get paid each second of computer downtime. I salute your perseverance. I salute your focus seeing that you are bipolar~~When I joined my company that sells its services to be a customer service call centre for a brand, they told us in training that we must not use last names or the location of our office ever.

The reason being back in the 2000's a woman that worked for the company got a message from reception that someone was there to drop off flowers for her.
It was a disgruntled customer that had his cable tv cut for not paying his bills.

Sadly this woman was shot dead because he was able to get her last name and the actual name of the call centre company and not the cable company that the cable company was being the call centre for and showed up at the office.

Since hearing that story, I make sure I dont give anything but my 1st name and never correct them when they say the wrong one like Jeff or James.~~I'm so pleased you're doing better now! Allow yourself some time to adjust. You were there for a long time so it's going to take a little while to really feel free from it - there's a reason people compare it to leaving an abusive relationship!

Don't beat yourself up for not being 100% okay right away. You'll get there. In the meantime, enjoy your new freedom. You deserve it :)~~Self care is so important. I too have run myself into the ground for a company that did not appreciate my efforts or my work ethic.  I left, and felt instant relief. Just remember, you were looking for a job when you found that one. You will find something soon!! Good job at recognizing your breaking point and acting on it.~~I invested most of my commissions. I can support myself for a year w/o income, and I learned new skills that got me off the call floor. Not feeling financially trapped makes all the difference no matter what line of work you are in. I've never really wanted a ""career"" so I'm constantly looking for new ways to make money and how to make my 9-5 work better for me. Call center work should be viewed as a means to an end.~~",The commenter had a bad experience working in a call center for two months and is now looking for a new job. They mention that they were forced to work in a call center because there wasn't enough staff and that they are still recovering from the long-term effects of extreme anxiety. They
7.0,You made the best choice for you. Your health is the most important thing and no job should ever come to that expense. I was at that point years ago in another job (not call center) and you could not pay me 6 figures to go back to that job.~~,The commenter believes that the person made the best choice for their health and that no job should come at the expense of their health. They share their own experience of not being paid enough to return to a job where their health was the most important factor.
8.0,"Your key phrase ""Most rational people respond with"" is the core of it. She wasn't at all rational. I don't blame you for being upset. I would be too. I think any of us would be upset for being called something ugly for trying to help. Just remember that the condemnations of the crazy don't count, and she's the one with the issues. Keep up the good work!~~Ugh. Yes. I call patients throughout the day, most will be okay without an interpreter when they say they are, some will allow an interpreter as sort of back-up if were misunderstanding each other. There are a few that dont want an interpreter and its written in CAPS in their chart. Those are a bit more difficult. Especially when its on the phone, and I cant see their mouth movements. ~~I work for a shoe company, so this week all calls have been about missing/stolen packages, refunds and order cancellations

 When they hear something they dont want to hear, its when they start. For this company, they look for people who have a  95% english level, so colloquial terms or something of the sort is not an issue, but the accent or the pronunciation of certain words is something that well, we have different 

 A couple of days ago a lady told me to transfer her to someone from the United States because she wanted someone who knew about shoes ????????????~~I also worked for a military affiliated credit union and we had a few workers that were bilingual and usually worked the Spanish only line because we needed them there the most, but occasionally English callers would get that line. I had two separate occasions where my peers had to transfer calls to me because some idiot racist claimed they couldnt understand the rep or that since the rep greeted them in Spanish they didnt want to work with them! Ok so youre telling me my friend two desks over doesnt know how to service your acct even tho shes worked here for 10+ years, but you trust me to do so with less than a year experience? I absolutely took my time and asked so many questions for a simple transaction that they wished they had stuck with the lightly accented rep!~~I'm American born, have the ""news dialect,"" with a very Anglo-sounding name. Still had one customer say, ""What'd you say yer name was, ____? You sound like yer frum India."" I corrected her no, I was in the Northwestern US at the edge of the Rockies.

Incredulous to the point of being nearly delusional~~I used to just pick a random greeting to answer calls with.  


""Good Morning.  Thank your for calling {company} support.  How may I help you this morning.""  


It's the middle of the afternoon, where are you?  


""California""  


Bullshit!   It's afternoon there too!  


Boss after listening to one of these calls told me to just say ""Good Day"".  


Of course since I spent 2 years in Australia, that turned into ""G'Day"" in a full Aussie accent.  


There were some pauses from the other end.   Which I interpreted as:   ""He's not in the US so I should ask for a US support center, but Australian so he's most likely white.""~~I had dealings with a similar customer.

Hello, you are through to Murka, May I take your name?

I am and can prove in a court of law that I am Karen McKarenface.

(Suppressing a smile). Thank you, now could please confirm your full address,

I do and can prove in a court of law that I live at [her address].

(Now suppressing laughter) And finally, what is your date of birth?

I have and can prove in a court of law the birthdate of [yada yada yada].

She then demanded something and hung up without checking if it was possible. 

Looking at the notes she had complained that we had sent her a reminder and it distressed her because she is disabled and we were discriminating against her. So we sent her a leaflet of the services we offer people with additional needs and she complained that offering her services we wouldnt offer someone else was discrimination.~~theres no excuse for acting dismissive and calloused like that. even if youre strung out and overworked and so numb as to be beyond actually caring, you can still throw a few niceties out there and fake it. you dont have to emotionally care about the person to realize that pretending to care is the right thing to do. 

a lot of people in healthcare dont get that because they arent trained in customer service the same way as us, but it always shocks me when* their common human decency doesnt kick in in these cases

*edited when to then, because not everyone is a jerk like this~~Im irish I work in a call center here, iv worked for numerous different companies, Im multi lingual sonic worked with people in French,German but  mostly UK and irish people . I work a night shift now supporting US and Oceania. No offense but Americans ( followed closely by aussies) are awful to deal with. I have a pretty flat mid Atlantic accent and iv had some seriously horrible stuff said to me. If they dont get what they want its because Im foreign and they ask to speak to Americans or make comments about us being cheap labor ( I shit you not) . I know theres probably people who get it worse than me, so I honestly feel terrible for them because I get shit, and Im a native English speaker.~~If youre in the US, I have what I think is something you might want to try. State and local government. Its not always the best paid job but its stable work. 
My office loves the two bilingual employees we have. Main reason is because youd be a twofer, regular employee and interpreter for the price of one person. 
State offices are notoriously cheap and would be happy to have you. 

Good luck, life is too short to be miserable!~~Reminds me of an encounter I had the other day on public transit. I live in the US.

(Broken English) ""Excuse me, do you speak English?""

""Yeah""

""Do you know how to get to (incomprehensible)?""

""What?""

""(Incomprehensible)""

(I give a blank look)

""(Heavy sigh) DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH OR NOT?""

""Yes, ma'am, English is my first language, but I don't know what you just said.""

""Well, how do you get to the mall?""

""...which mall?""

""THE MALL""

""Ma'am, this train goes to 5 different malls. You'll have to be more specific than that.""

--
This continued for a few more minutes. She wanted to go to the outlet mall. Which, if you were wondering... that train doesn't go to &gt;.&gt;~~Then you get a guy request an interpreter, but he (caller) understands English perfectly and continues to reply to you (mostly in English) as soon as you finish - w/o the interpreter saying a word, to the point where the interpreter asks you ""do you even need me here?""

I had to reply ""that's up to the caller. I don't know Spanish, so **I** need you, but if he's willing to communicate in English, then you can go.""

The caller switched to Spanish real quick!~~Even Americans get shit. I'm an American from the MidAtlantic, never lived anywhere else.  One time an older customer called in for help with his account. I informed him that I couldn't assist him with his account unless he told me his password (fraud concern). He spent a few minutes verbally abusing me and when he figured out I wasn't going to budge, his wife grabbed the phone from him, screamed, ""Go back to China!"" in my ear and hung up. I've never been anywhere near China.~~I feel bad for people that have to deal with my family. My family members tend to hang up and keep calling back until they get a white rep because they cant understand them even if they speak perfectly clearly. One of my biggest pet peeves. Its like as soon as they hear a name thats something other than the most stereotypical white name like John, Cole, or Brandon, they become the most racist fucks to have ever walked the earth. ~~I was a bilingual French/English call center rep back in the day...this guy comes through on the french queue, I answer in French.

As soon as he's on the line he starts yelling in my ear that he just called before and the menu was only in English, no French option...i tell him as nicely as possible that the French queue is open 24/7 and I've been speaking French all day long.

He says he's going to lodge a complaint and we're in Quebec here, rant rant rant.

DUDE, you obviously found the French line and got me...speaking in French. You definitely chose the wrong menu option you dipshit lol.~~I used to supervise a small multi-national team, with a lot of the team located in India.  I gave them instructions to transfer the call of someone demanding an ""American"" to the call center in Mexico.  For some reason, the caller would still get upset.

Hey, they are in ""America"". Last time I checked, Mexico is in North America.  My team enjoyed messing with the bigots.~~I'm ambiguously brown, but I get told a lot I sound like a teenage white girl. I got a LOT of ""I'm so glad I am finally talking to a white person!"" Go drown in diarhea you useless infected twats, fuck.

Edit: that's directed at the racists in my head, not at you lovely folks.~~I speak English as my first, last, and only language, but since I have a slight lisp since childhood (that thankfully comes off as an accent) I get this semi often. 

When people do ask 'where are you from?' I lie and say Germany, which is a total lie so it gets them off my back but most people fall for it. ~~This reminds me a little of the experience of my ex. He spoke fluent Vietnamese, and it was honestly kind of startling when he did it, seeing as he was of mostly Italian ancestry. I was kinda excited to see the reactions of people in the little Vietnamese restaurants we would go to sometimes, but he said that it would be insulting to them, implying that their English wasnt good enough. 


But also, he told me about how he had broken it out once, when there was a genuine communication issue, and they immediately started trying to convince him to marry their daughter ~~My last call center worked predominantly with customers in the American South. They had stores in almost all 50 states, but a bulk of them were in some of those first 50. The one before that was with a telecom that had after-hours help in the Philippines. 

The (excuse my French) fucking mind-boggling amount of useless, racist, xenophobic, borderline-Nazi, crap that these inbred, mouth breathing, knuckle dragging, Luddites, spewed forth amazed me. And I'm Southern and raised by a bunch of ""good ole' boys"".

Everything from the standard ""Thank god I got an American."" to ""Y'all need to fire those chi\*\*s that you got workin'. Can't understand half of what they say.""~~As an American, let me preface this by saying, I am really impressed with your English writing. 

I did tech support calls for many years, but I think you had the tougher job....sounds like more sales oriented or regular customer service dealing with returns and things, which I imagine was a non stop barrage of calls.

Glad you got of the call center life too!~~","The commenter sympathizes with the original poster's experience of being called ""ugly"" for trying to help a customer who didn't want an interpreter. They also mention that they work for a shoe company and offer services to customers who have a high level of English. They also mention that they"
8.0,"People get so bothered by that. One thing I really hate (in a similar vein) is when they open with, ""Thank goodness you speak English!!"" 

Like, how am I supposed to respond to that? I usually don't, or I give some generic statement about a language barrier being frustrating but I'll take over the issue from there. I can't just insult the outsourced workers in the Philippines, if for no other reason than the calls are recorded. (That's not the only reason though.) They try their best, you know? 

People sometimes are so ignorant and gross. As if an ""American"" is more qualified to help over a ""Canadian"" simply by merit of their nationality.~~I work in North Carolina, and one of the older gentleman I work with has a very Southern accent. I've been around him enough that I usually just tune him out while he's on the phone. He also tends to be very frugal.

About a year ago, I realized he had been on the phone a long time when I heard him exclaim, ""Ireland!?!?!"" in a horrified voice. That caught my attention. ""I absolutely love the customer service I received from you. It's the best I've ever gotten from this company, but I'm not sure if I want to pay the overseas phone charges to get you the next time.""~~I've had a customer before ask me where I was located and I would say so and so state located in the US. Then they proceeded to get upset and say they wanted someone located in the US. I would then have to give them a geography lesson and educate them where my state was located in the US.~~I used to work at an American outsourced call center for a mobile carrier regarding customer complaints/issues for both their online orders for phones and phone orders for phones. Because of how small our group was I was M-F from 1:30pm-10pm the only supervisor. Im a very American sounding but also very female. I would get a lot (were talking 3 or more a day) of people wanting a male supervisor. I would explain I was more than capable of helping them and also Im the only supervisor on duty m-f 1:30 to 10. They would get pissed hang up and call back and get me again ~~Sheesh going to the ER always sucks and honestly getting priority means youre really sick or really hurt (unfortunately been there, done that). Even when I was at the doctors office six months ago super super super sick and the doctor told me that either I could drive or they were calling me an ambulance, I still had to wait two hours to be seen (and admitted). 

PS I drove myself, swung by the house on the way home for an overnight bag since I knew there was a strong likelihood I was being admitted...which I was,  it thankfully only for 24 hours. 

PPS You know youre really sick when you actually enjoy the hospital food.~~I am a US based, American male sounding American male, so I get to avoid most of the shit, but I often get callers who think I sound like them, so I must think like them too. 

I got one caller who was calling back on a claim he stated he was in the middle of filing. He said the rep he spoke with was rude, didnt know what she was doing, he wanted to talk to a manager once the claim was done etc etc. As he was speaking. I pull up the claim. 

Completed flawlessly. Not even a typo. I verify some information with the caller, let him vent, apologize about the service and let him know that we will look into it. As we get to the close of the call he makes an offhand comment about, Oh, but she was a girl you know. At the close of the call, I go get my manager, who is a very competent young woman, and let her know the situation.~~I work in a call centre in Australia and one of my colleagues, such a beautiful soul, is from Columbia and she has an accent. The customer was onshore and was verbally abusing her saying shit about her not being Australian. It was disgusting. Another one of my colleagues, she's my manager now, is from New Zealand, a customer had her in tears because of her accent. It's absolutely awful for them both. They both work with me and nobody would dare complain about my Australian accent but are demanding to speak to someone onshore when they get those girls. It makes me so angry because of how they leave the call just really hurt and attacked. They give the same level of service as I do, if not better. It's just bullshit.~~Hate to tell you, but there are people out there who honestly think this is a clever ""hack"" to shorten their hold time. They intentionally choose the Spanish option, expecting that a bilingual representative will serve them in English after they bypass the longer wait on the main line. And it often works. I'm glad that your organization doesn't encourage this and sends them back to the end of the queue.~~I was born and raised in the American midwest (but not where the 'midwestern' accent comes from - I've never heard anyone actually speaking with that accent in person). I've had people scream at me that I sound foreign and that they refuse to speak with me. As far as I know, I mostly have the standard American accent (the kind you'll hear in movies). 

I've wondered sometimes if that's just the default way those sorts talk to customer service. If they just come in automatically swinging 'you're foreign I demand to speak to someone who speaks English/is an American/etc immediately!' without even bothering to listen to the other person's actual way of speaking.~~I worked in a call center for a few months. I worked for a company that did background checks. I once had a lady on the phone that was arguing with me over something that we absolutely could not do (of course) because it was illegal. I explained the law multiple times, but she just kept getting more upset.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually she said ""What do you know about laws in the US?! You're probably in India!"" I was born in the southern US and have a southern accent. I said ""Ma'am, do I sound like I'm from India?"" She paused for a few seconds, then demanded to speak to a supervisor who told her the exact thing I had told her.~~I literally had someone read off a VIN saying sh*t like ""c for cat, b for bat, v like vat"".... Dlsieirjenslxckfjei!!!!! And mind you, most of the people I write insurance for are taught the phonetic alphabet when they start their ""careers"". I've just started saying ""... and if you can share the VIN with me phonetically that really helps me out!""~~I work in door hardware/door security. Speak mostly to locksmiths each day. Our most senior person was never a locksmith, but she's been doing the job for 27 years, and knows the industry inside and out. We occasionally have older callers who REFUSE to believe anything a woman tells them. So we have to waste a male team mate's time, just so he can literally repeat the identical info. We call this ""needing a daddy"" i.e., ""Hey, Paul, this guy has an x-type door and needs x-type product, but he needs a daddy."" It's ridiculous.


And don't even get me started on our downstate callers who refuse to speak with my black team members. It's like, dude, between those two, they have 40 years of experience. I have 3. But you prefer to talk to a white lady? Wtf? ~~There is NO excuse for behaving this way (the heartless rep). Im sorry you had to interpret that kind of call, it must be so hard. If its any consolation AT ALL, OP, Im sure having someone to interpret properly is at least some small comfort to this poor woman, rather than having to struggle through the hardest moment of her life in a language she doesnt completely understand.~~Seeing this story gave me bad flashbacks to my hospital operator job. I definitely dont miss it! 
People calling the ER for medical advice after all the doctors offices and urgent cares are closed was the worst thing for me since I had to tell them that they dont give medical advice over the phone. They were always terrible to me about it.  

I'm glad you are able to call her out on being rude though. I was usually only allowed to hang up if they were cussing at me.~~I worked for a woman, that had commanded the English language perfectly,  yet when she answered her phone she would use the most heavy Asian accent she could muster. If she didn't want to deal with the person on the other line, she would say. ""me no speaka de English"".~~Aww crap. Ok native English speaker never had to use translation line. That being said...

I have a number of issues that make conversations difficult.  My mind jumps around when you ping a thought.  BP, SAD, CPTSD, anxiety, social avoidant, many concussions over my lifetime, neurological problems, spinal, cardiac, urology, etc etc.etc. nothing is simple and my mind goes everywhere. 

Your caller wasn't me, but I hope if we ever interact you peek at my cpt codes to know it's not me being rude, me little brain goes haywire.

I hope the rest of your workweek has less frustration~~Sometimes I have difficulty understanding thick accents too, be it Indian, Filipino, Australian, Louisianan, Newfoundland etc. It's not about race, it's about not being able to understand the words I'm hearing. Anybody whose job involves speaking to customers should be able to enunciate clearly enough that their target customers can easily understand what they're saying.

&amp;#x200B;

It's great that you can parse people's words through shitty distorted phone quality but not everyone can. Stop tilting at windmills.

Edit to add: Also American is not a race.~~Once upon a time, I worked at a kiosk at a train station. There were some tourists from Russia, so they asked me if I could speak Russian. I said no and then they became mad because I could not speak Russian!

Mind you, I am a dutch woman, living in The Netherlands.~~Am American, worked call center in America. We were told when asked to identify as being in Mexico because that's where the closest local corporate branch office was (Tex-Mex border). The sheer number of people who complained there was no American office was staggering. Usually calls were dropped in the first 15 seconds, especially if we mentioned that for American assistance they needed to go to the local retailer instead of calling in. Edit: spelling~~Well...to be perfectly fair, although it is the same language, obviously, sometimes accents can make others difficult to understand.  Typical Irish isnt as difficult for Americans as, say, Glaswegian, but as an American having travelled extensively and having family from the UK I can honestly say there are times during conversations Ive just had to smile and nod because I had NO IDEA what someone just said.

Plus Im hard of hearing, which makes it worse.  So yeah, if someone is already super frustrated on the phone and they continually get customer support with an accent they have trouble understanding...its an issue.~~",The commenter expresses frustration with customers who speak poorly in a foreign language and suggests that they should take responsibility for their own language skills. They also share their own experience of working at an American outsourced call center where they were the only female supervisor.
8.0,"I also am in Missouri and worked customer service for a military affiliated bank as it was the biggest client for our call center. I love our veterans but honestly military families can be the worst for doing this type of thing. They're so into patriotism they hate the idea of their bank outsourcing to other countries. We had a guy that always struggled with the end of call survey numbers cause he had a Hispanic accent. Was sweetest guy and did well on technical details but people still rated him low constantly~~I had this happen as the desginated Englishman in a Scottish call centre. If a customer kicked off and demanded to speak to somebody English they'd pass the phone to me. One time I called the woman and went ""Hi Mrs Smith, I understand you wanted to speak to somebody English?"" and she immediately went ""What!? I asked for someone English!!"" and hung up on me. Apparently I'd picked up a bit of a twang :D~~&lt;3s I've had co-workers who've actually taken on different phone names because of things like this. I never know how to deal with racists without sounding like I support them or offending them. I once actually had to ask a customer to stop making racist comments (seriously, I didn't know there were so many derogatory names for natives) and then he got mad an hung up because he could hear my co-worker burst out laughing in the background.  ~~&gt; ""I want to speak to someone who speaks english"" - I'm Australian and i've even had someone say it to me before. It's just ignorant.

I work in America and we get ""Overnight calls"" for an Australian support line

I had someone go ""I was told I'd be speaking with someone that speaks Australian! I want an Austalian, someone that can understand me!""   To be honest I think he was just a Bogan

&gt;informs him that we won't tolerate people speaking to our employee's like that and cancelled his account with the company and tells him we don't want his business.

My last job that was one of my favorite things was to cancel Ahole customers. ~~I get the same thing since I have a unique name people don't think I'm American. Doesn't help that we're always getting transfer from India and the Philippines. They always want me to spell my name as if it matters since it's not like they're gonna talk to me again!~~I can't stand this and it's beyond frustrating! I'm a supervisor and they will speak English the entire call until hearing what they don't want.  Escalate to me with an interpreter and say they didn't understand and were misled. Not once have I reviewed a call that they ""didn't understand ""~~I'm from the Midwest (and according to my non-Midwestern b/f my accent is rather obvious) so I never get asked if I'm American, but I've been thanked for it because ""I don't want to talk to someone in India,"" which I find gross and I always hate dealing with someone who tells me that.~~We also have call centers overseas. I have yet to have someone that has issues with my Canadian accent, eh. Multiple times, the call will come in or I will call out and before I have a chance to introduce myself, I get asked/yelled:

&gt;Are you in the same country as me or overseas?!~~There is no magic answer, take the racist rant and move on with the call. Working in tech I get this just as often for people happy to hear confidence. Also just as bad is customers who come on the phone thanking you for being male like that makes you better at tech. You already have the right answer of ""that sucks but you have me on the phone and I'll help""~~Lol... I have an accent too, I hate it when they tell me:  Can you transfer me to someone in the states? 
Im like: Last time I check Texas was part of the United States, so I dont know where else you want me to transfer you.. 
usually that works but this time a customer asked me how was the weather where I was, (Im in the DFW area and so was the customer) making a comment along the lines that it might be sunny outside ( It was raining in DFW) I was taken back, cuz I had just told her we were in the same area, so I decided to be extra rude.
Well, its been raining all day, and since Im assuming you dont have any windows near by let me tell you, if you get out of the house today you will need an umbrella 
~~Ugh I experience this on a day to day basis as well. One time even hung up on a customer because of this. I am from The Netherlands and part of our call center is in Suriname. Sometimes colleagues in Suriname have to transfer a call to me. Then when I have the customer, a lot of times they say: Ah thank God I can finally speak to someone without that horrible accent. Like wtf. My colleagues work and live in Suriname, they speak Dutch perfectly. 

One time there was this older lady who said: I'm not being a racist, but I just like talking to you more than to.. ""those"" people. I told her that that actually was very racist of her and that she could call us back when she had found some more respect. Then I hung up. Never heard anything about it.~~I used to make my calls more awkward. I worked in a call centre in Ireland (I myself am American) and rather than 'thank god, someone who speaks English!' the phrasing was usually 'Thank god, someone who isn't *foreign*' ... Usually coupled with a rant about how they're taking all the Irish jobs. 

'Actually, I *am* a foreigner'

'What?'

'I'm not Irish. Technically, I'm a foreigner'

'But... uh... you know what I mean!'

'Actually I don't'

... Probably good I got out of there. &gt;.&gt;~~I speak several languages and have lived in other countries so I can usually handle accents. One time I was dealing with (I think) Macys customer support and I tried so hard but I just could not understand the rep and after ten minutes of asking her to repeat everything 3 times and being generally confused and frustrated, I said I dont mean to be rude and Im very sorry, but could you please transfer me to someone with a bit stronger English? I hated having to ask but I was at the end of my rope. But I certainly didnt imply the person was less intelligent or ask for an American. She transferred me to another Indian woman but with a much more understandable accent.~~My call center is a vendor and we run 5 lines of businesses for our client. In the lower tiers, they do more customer facing stuff (while I do tech support for the client call ins), and one day one of those agents, with an accent - I think Spanish, was crying in the bathroom after someone told her they were going to get her fired and deported and was in general rude to them. 

Me personally I want someone to say oh good you're American, just so I can be a snot and go ""Actually, I'm Canadian."" (Dual citizen thanks to my father.)~~Once I had a woman thank me for sounding white. Im from the Midwest (go Cards). She said sometimes its so hard to understand those -other- people but I can totally tell youre not like them (talking about non-native accents). I played completely dumb and said yeah, we work hard to make sure our phone systems are up to date so theyre crystal clear when were on the phone. And then she got quiet like she had expected me to agree with her and got caught off guard in her racism. ~~My mom worked at a health insurance call center located in Dallas,TX. She has a Hispanic name, but speaks English with no accent and fluently. 
People would yell at her about wanting to speak with an American as soon as she said her name. She assured them she was an American and they would request someone that was born one. She would assured them that she was born here. They would request someone who's family were all Americans.
Mainly the East Coast.~~I worked in a call centre in Scotland and there were a couple of times I had English people telling me they didn't want to speak to someone Scottish and wanted to speak to someone English. 

I took great joy each time I transferred them to my colleague Arfan, who was born in England but had an Indian accent due to time spent with family in India.

INB4 Arfan also thought this was funny and would ham up the accent whenever he got one of these transfers.~~When I worked at a call center, I had customer who didnt pay their bill on time.  They understood that they were late.  They got a late fee.  They understood how this worked as they were late basically every month.  They wanted to never be charged late fees again.  I told them I would waive it (mostly to get them off the phone), but I couldn't permanently stop their account from getting late fees.  End result they said ""I hope you get aids and die"", then hung up.

Moral of the story you can't win sometimes.~~Oh, I would have loved to see the look on the guy's face when you told him you weren't English.
   
I worked in a call center in the US, where I now live. Had some old guy in Kentucky poorly repeat something I said and added ""listen to you, you can barely speak English!""    
Buddy, I was born and raised in Australia. It's called an accent. You're from Kentucky, you got a pretty good one too.~~I had someone call and immediately ask if I was in America. I said I was and asked how I could help. 

""You don't sound American. You have an accent!"" She screams with a southern accent so thick our IVR couldn't understand her. 

""Ma'am, I'm in Massachusetts. It doesn't get much more America than that.""~~Double dumbass on me... After a year working for my company, nobody told me that we have a Spanish line of bilingual service reps we can transfer them to instead of dialing into the damn language line and having every conversation take 3 times as long. Still though... Why did they push 1 for English?! ~~I got a super sweet lady last week who was born exactly one year after women got the right to vote in the US. She told me about how her mother was a suffragette and spent a week in jail for protesting and told me our credit card was the first card she ever got in her own name instead of her husbands. She was so sweet, I was smiling the rest of the night.~~I work at a call center for health insurance and we have call centers all throughout the US and other countries.

Sooooo many people would be straight up rude when they would ask to speak to someone in the US.

One time my coworker got one of those calls and the caller was arguing with her that she wasnt in the US.. umm dude shes sitting right in front of me.. ~~",The commenter worked as a customer service representative for a military-affiliated bank and had a customer who had a Hispanic accent. The commenter had to ask the customer to speak to someone English because they didn't understand the customer's accent. The commenter also had to ask a customer to speak to
8.0,"I remember taking a call and the lady on the other end asked where we were located. I gave her the state but didn't give her the city and she ended up asking what state MI stood for. I asked her why and she said I sounded like I wasn't from the US. I went through all the states that started with a ""M"" and had an ""i"" before I got to Michigan just to push her buttons and she ended up hanging up. I didn't know i would be having a pop quiz that day lol~~My friend got a call from some misogynist and she explained, in response to his request, that she could not transfer him to a man but he could speak to her supervisor *Amy*, or her manager *Crystal*, or the call center's big boss *Sue Ellen*.  He hung up. (*Names changed to protect the innocent, but they all had very feminine names so there was no mistake.*)~~Something that got to me when I was working in a call centre was being told ""Get a job."" I snarkily replied, ""Yeah, I really should, this a shit way to spend my friday nights."" And hung up on him, we were really busy and the guy was wasting our time. ~~What do you mean the supervisor says you need to do something about your accent? No you do NOT. They can't treat you like that, can they? 
I live in one of the lower south east states. I have about as southron an accent as you can have, though I do try to tone it down when I'm working. Would you believe I have had people tell me that they wanted someone from America before? I mean, c'mon!! You bout can't get more American than the South! Except maybe if you are from Texas..... :D~~I've always pushed people towards them if there's any doubt. Often they will want a family member to interpret for them.

""I'm sorry, but we legally have to be sure you understand and there are no mistakes.""

I worked for a place that had internal volunteers who spoke other languages, I refused to use them because there's no point having a call recording of two people speaking spainish when nobody listening to the recording understands spainish.~~We had a husband and wife who kept calling and berating everyone. Just nasty and rude, it was pretty common to get people like this but they just wanted to curse at us and hang up. Then they got my coworker, who took no shit ever,  but he happened to speak their language- not a common second language at all. I have no idea what he said to them but it was incredible, involved a lot of yelling and then slamming down the phone. They didnt call back.~~At a place I worked at we had an older middle aged woman in customer service. She would multiple times a day laugh like a hyena while telling people she couldnt understand their accent. She did not even try. 

She was an all around shitty human being for reasons aside from that so I was pretty damn happy when she got fired.~~A politician accused the company I work for of racism on twitter. Then we got a bunch of calls from people complaining. So the company put out a statement that we're not racist. Which resulted in a bunch of calls from people complaining that we're communists who support BLM and antifa~~I live in Australia. I have had colleagues be treated like dirt because they have an accent even though one was a better consultant than me. I had to deal with a racist customer that refused to let my colleague help her and the cow kept trying to bait me into being racist. No ma'am. I'm gonna help you professionally because it's my job but I am never going to throw my colleagues under the bus because of your racist ass.~~I used to work night shift for a bank call center with a center in the Philippines. We would always get people hating on our Filipino coworkers and we got tired of it. One night my buddy takes a call and the customer says what thieves they are and how incompetent they are and blah blah blah. Well he was telling us about it and says ""hey guys, listen to this."" So he finishes the call and the caller said ""you've been so amazing. Thank you so much. Btw, where are you located?"" Without missing a beat he says ""Alabang, Philippines,  ma'am."" Silence.... Then she hung up. ~~I work in a call center in the US and people still automatically default to my being located in India....I work with a publishing house who has never had any call centers in India. 

I have been screamed at, immediately after answering calls to get someone who speaks REAL English on the phone 

Okay honey, sure. ~~I'm from East Texas and have worked to speak without so much of my natural twang. I lived down along the Texas / Mexico border and now there's a tiny bit of a Spanish accent mixed in. I don't mind someone having a different accent than me as long as we can work together to work out the problem I've called about. It's a big, old world and there's lots of variety. Variety is the spice of life.~~My boss has been trying to get me to certify for handling Spanish escalations and call reviews, since I retained my four years of high school Spanish somewhat well. Yeah, no, not well enough to put my insurance licenses at risk with an erroneous translation. 

You made the right choice, OP.~~Well, that's annoying as all get out.  I suspect you were not at all rude, but truly - he doesn't want to check the antenna, so therefore you were rude!  Then he doubles down on it and insists the problem is with the TV, and SINCE HE KNOWS MORE THAN YOU, he will absolutely NOT CHECK THE ANTENNA cause that might work and he would be wrong.  The TV channels would be coming in but HE WOULD BE WRONG.  I sure hope you don't get fired over this bozo, good luck!!!!~~I've had to tell customers to stop interrupting or being rude to interpreters before.  They didn't appreciate it, but I treat every interpreter I speak to with nothing but respect because without them, I wouldn't be able to do my job so they need to be able to do theirs.  Also, my Interpreters know it's ok to cut them off and say ""I just need this answered, please keep it short""~~You might want to take down the company name.

I may or may not currently be an employee.

Jesus fucking Christ are their callers assholes. And yes, I get several calls a day where a redneck is screaming ""ARE YOU IN MURRKAH? I CAINT UNDERSTAND THEM FEELA-PEEN-YOS OR PAKIS!"" Before I can even get my greeting out.

I just want to say ""no one can understand your Boomhauer sounding ass either, you fucking hillbilly"".~~One time I had a customer that claimed he was being discriminated against. The only information I really had to go off was his name and it was something similar to John Smith. To this day I would love to know on what factor he felt he was being discriminated on.~~I get calls like that all of the time....and funny story: my company's reps are ALL based in America! In Las Vegas to be specific. 

I had someone ask me once ""Where are you from?"" I said, ""California"". She asked ""No, really...where are you from?"" I said, ""I grew up in XYZ, California."" 

She asked to be transferred to an American. I said ""I \*am\* American, are you?

She finally stopped with the questions and I was able to assist her.~~I feel like if I had immediately offered the transfer I could see why she might be offended but I did try a few times to explain it in English before I offered it. If I were in another country that English wasn't the primary official language I would try to communicate in the official language. If someone offered me English I'd be like ""hell ya, please transfer me"".

I guess next time I won't offer, I'll just immediately transfer lol. Just kidding. She was just an asshole.~~I have the same thing with my workplace, they're in India and have very good but accented English, but holy shit the number of times I've had a transfer and their response as been ""customer wants to hear Australian voice"" and said customer turns out to be a douche of AAA+++ Premium grade quality, its literally the one case where I CBF trying to resolve things ASAP.

Also funny because my manager started at one of our offshore callcentres and has been brought over and then promoted a few times, its awkward when they want to complain about outsourcing to ""stinkin' shitskins"" and then they get her.~~I am an American with a midwestern accent. How I want to set these people on fire when they are expressing "" oh the last rep i spoke to didnt speak english"" like WTF? How am i supposed to react to that??? Serious question , how do I react to that, call out the casual racism and remain professional?~~I once had a caller talk patronizingly slow to me, and demand to know my ""real"" name because he KNEW I was some ""Outsourced Arab in India."" Credit where it's due: he complimented me for having a very good fake American accent.

Can't make this shit up.

Also, I live south of Cleveland, and am whiter than newspaper soaked in miracle whip. But, whatever makes you sleep better at night, champ.~~I have an issue where I work that sometimes people call asking for a Spanish translator when we have none. Its a 10 person Human Resources officewe dont have translators. Them: I need a Spanish translator. Me: Im sorry we dont have one, what is your question so I can help? Them: none of you speak Spanish? Me: no. Them: are you sure. Me: yes. Them: oh well it wasnt important, click. I do speak it enough to be able to communicate with family and some basic sentences in Cantonese to speak to my bf family, but definitely nowhere near fluent enough to go over hr policy lol~~When the call started out with, ""I'm SOOOOO glad you speak English!"", said with all the subtext that implies, I knew exactly what kind of call I was in for.

When these guys would inevitability ask for a manager, the first transfer was always a co-worker in my joint (3rd would get you a real sup).  My favorite thing to do with these disputes was to transfer them to one of my co-workers with a thick accent... had a cool dude on my shift who was perfectly intelligible, just really thick English accent, and he'd play my Supervisor for these douchbags.

Loved flipping the script on those fools.~~&gt; ***Her:*** ""No, YOU are LEGALLY BOUND to transfer me to someone in the U.S. It is a federal requirement that you make sure I speak with an american""

Of course, it would be funny if you said you were transferring them to Georgia, and sent them to a call center either in Tbilisi or on the Armenian border.~~I work in an international callcentre - lots of languages, global service. And the callers we dread most? American. They're generally considered to be the most difficult, demanding and unreasonable. I'm personally rather fond of Eastern Europeans. If your colleagues would open their minds a bit they might find themselves pleasantly surprised. 

Casual racism in the workplace is completely unacceptable. Time for a complaint to HR or to management.

8.0,"Thank you for the story, it reminded me of my days working as an on phone spanish translator. My native language is spanish, yet sometimes spanish speakers come up with words that make no sense.


Reminds me of a lady who called in once, needing information on the 'Gua Gua'.


For the life of me, I had never heard that word used in any context. When I asked her to explain what it was, all she could say was the 'Gua Gua' that does what she needs. Even our google overlord was stumpped, not matches.


Her daughter came on the phone and politely explained that 'Gua Gua' was some type of Latin New York slang for a bus. I mean, that doesn't even make sense as an idiom or an onomatopoeia. Isn't it easier just to say bus?


You learn something new everyday I guess.~~Unless this is a trend, If they review your other calls, theyll find this was a single occurrence.  


If this was a single occurrence then Id give either a documented verbal or written warning and a plan - perhaps it will disappear in 6 months or so if nothing else.

Only worry about the things you can directly control - check out r/stoicism.~~I'd like to point out that the people that usually have these opinions don't speak a dialect close to anyone else in the country. I'm from the south and I hear ""If they're going to come to America, they need to learn to speak American!"" in the dumbest southern accent you can imagine. Nobody understands YOU and you want people to adapt? GTFOH. I have a southern accent, but I do my best to check it when I'm talking to people from any other part of the english speaking world because I know it's tough to understand sometimes. As long as I can understand someone, idgaf what dialect they use.~~I have an absolute idiot of a coworker that when ANYONE and I mean ANYONE with even a hint of an accent she transfers them to me because she cant understand people who dont speak American. Im not great at understanding accents but some of the people that call sound American just with a very small accent and one of them had a speech impediment so it wasnt even like she wasnt American. My coworker is just a cunt.~~Im so sorry you had to go through that. Dealing with the public at times like this is *so* incredibly difficult. Even if we think were the best at not letting them get to us, theres always that one person who will. Ive had to hang up the call quickly so they didnt hear me cry a few times myself while working at a call center. Hopefully he  did learn from his mistake and genuinely felt bad enough to never do it again to someone else, but that still doesnt excuse having done it in the first place. I hope you and your family are staying healthy and safe! ~~My sister works for a bank in the UK.  During the BLM thing she had to tell a customer she had only spoke to over the phone, they wouldn't be giving him a loan.  She got accused of being racist and he bought up about BLM multiple times.  Our dad's mixed race ffs.  She said there was no way she could sign off on one as he looked a terrible bet.~~So, just for kicks I went back to review the account today, thought I would be in for a laugh, boy was a wrong. My 'supervisor' (a senior rep) had argued with him for 30-40 minutes before hanging up on him (score) then the head of the department, who cut the bill to 1/2 of our minimum settlement amount. We're going to reward condescention and insults with pennies on the dollar settlement, really?~~I feel your pain! My job is actually bilingual, so I do speak French regularly and fluently BUT it is not my first language. 

If I make even the slightest mistake (""le rue"" instead of ""la rue"" for example) people will either mock me, switch to English and refuse to speak French again or continue speaking French and just correct me in the rudest way possible. 

One of my first French calls here, I was so nervous I stuttered a lot (nerves make my language skills go bye bye). My supervisor pulled me into her office, slammed the door behind me and asked if I really did speak French or if I just pretended for the interview. Thankfully, she doesn't work here anymore.
~~These people are the worst to deal with, especially when they would purposely hang up after working with a technician for awhile, then you get them.

Sometimes, however, there were times where the technician would note what the actual problem was and how to fix it when they call back in. A few co-workers of mine would start their troubleshooting at the very beginning instead of continuing in order to get back at them. Eventually their issue was resolved, but at the expense of an additional 30 minutes to 1 hour.~~I once had a guy trying to get around a reconnection fee by saying something like, ""Look, I know you're black, I can tell. Black people have to help each other out."" Being a white man, I decided to just let him go on thinking I'm black, because correcting him could bring the call to a point where if the customer doesn't get what he wants its due to race, not policy. Looking back though, he could easily have just been fucking with me. I sound pretty damn white.~~I have been known to use a fake accent on certain calls. One of the many things my center does is gated neighborhood access. If residents don't update their information with their HOA, we can't let them in. This usually results in a screaming request for a supervisor.

If they're already threatening my operators I will do my worst ""Microsoft scammer"" voice. Several have threatened to come find me and kick my ass, to which I respond ""Pack a lunch, it's a long drive across the Pacific!""~~I refuse to deal with companies that will not employ people who are not fluent in English. I am very hard of hearing and simply cannot understand through the accents. I ask for someone fluent and and if they cannot provide someone, I simply choose to converse by print or find a company that can accommodate my disability. ~~When I used to work in a call center and I'd get a transfer where the person would say ""thank goodness, someone who speaks English"", I'd always act oblivious and ask them if they'd pressed two for Spanish by accident just to hear their racist brains shut down trying to formulate a response.~~That sucks. I'm so sorry he said that and it upset you. Working on the phone with the general public can make you genuinely hate ""people"".

But once you've shrugged off this eejit, remember you got it through to him that he can't just go round saying shit to people. You had no obligation to listen to his ""apology"" or him getting to backtrack... But he knew he f'd up. Maybe he'll think twice before airing his ""opinions"" in future. Maybe.

(lots of """"'s used to avoid completely littering post with expletives)

I hope you can treat yourself to something nice this evening, even if it's making everyone you love watch a TV show that you like, a nice dinner or dessert, cuddle chasing with the kids, quiet time with an old beloved album... You did yourself and your family proud.~~That's some bullshit right there. 

The most annoying thing about it is that the US doesn't even have an official language. It's de facto English, but as you no doubt already know the second most widely spoken language there is Spanish. Hell if I was ever to migrate to the US, I'd actually start learning Spanish ASAP because of how widespread it must be there. Would be a bit daft not to learn it when a huge portion of Americans can speak it.

It's the same at my call centre though, if you come through on a specific language line you can't help the caller in their own language even if you speak it fluently. So ridiculous. If it's such a big issue, refer the call recording to the appropriate QM person and move on.~~I have a non traditional American name also. This lady was mad at me and started going off saying I was in Egypt and didn't understand how things are done in America. The customer is always right blah blah lol. People are such bitches thats why closed her ticket as repaired  bitch ass~~Sorry to hear about what's happened to you dude, stuff like that is just too fucking much for our jobs. I'm on emails only but getting many insults just because of my foreign name. All these fuckers deserve is hanging up on them or deleting their accounts and making them pay for it.~~I wasnt taught Spanish by my parents. My entire family speaks it and my grandmother doesnt even speak English. I took Spanish in school and taught my self. My mom would talk in Spanish when she didnt want me to know what she was saying. I moved across the country away from my family and my husbands family are not Hispanic at all. I stopped speaking Spanish because I didnt really have anyone to talk to. My mom will only have conversations in English because when she was growing up she was made fun of and belittled for speaking Spanish so she wished that my sister and I would look white and not speak Spanish so we would have an easier life. I forgot it all since I havent spoken it in so long but I can read it and understand it but cant actually speak it.~~When I was working at a Call Center this is a very common thing. 
I am a foreigner and I have an obvious accent (which for some reason gets confused with Filipino accent, despite being latin american). I sometimes wouldn't even finish my greeting and certain customers would DEMAND to speak with someone who ""actually knows english"".
They wouldn't even wait until I was done. It was so annoying~~I work with phone interpreters every day and honestly God bless you for your patience  I must admit that I will interrupt an interpreter when I needed to verify the spelling and I got the spelling from the caller just so that you dont have to go through the phonetic alphabet for 20 letters though lol hope thats not annoying. I always worry Ill get on the nerves of you guys! 

Thank you for your hard work, though, it is greatly appreciated. My bad calls/days are often made so much better because of you being kind &amp; understanding.~~About the only time I have an issue when speaking to a call center is when the accent is so thick I can't understand them. I do have a slight hearing issue which doesn't help, and I apologize that I have to keep asking them to repeat themselves. Sometimes it is just ridiculous! I'm sure it is just as frustrating to the tech to have to keep repeating themselves.

I once got a guy in Colombia. We discussed the weather and the country as he was delving into my issue, and at one point I complemented him on his English as he probably spoke it better than I. He thought that was hysterical.~~","The commenter shares their experience of working as an on-phone Spanish translator and notes that sometimes Spanish speakers come up with words that don't make sense, such as ""Gua Gua"" for a bus.

Also, any time a call comes in from the 626 area code I...let the call bounce. Or at least I want to.~~If this was the first time, and they review your other calls youll probably be fine.  I dont think theyd fire someone in my office for one unintentional screw-up.

This is a tales based subreddit, as such we expect all posts to be actual tales/stories portraying interactions you've had with callers/customers (i.e. there must be some sort of narrative and you must tell us a story). Rants, complaints, memes, help, general discussion and advice all belong on our sister subreddit /r/callcentres.
~~Had that before. And I straight up told them to call back when they are less vulgar. They got so angry from my response, they moved to another provider. At least I didn't get any repercussions from it, boss told me I did exactly the right thing and to not tolerate that kind of language.~~Worked in a call center for almost 10 years,  we didn't have interpreters on staff, we just occasionally had agents that happened to know a different language. 

So one day,  I got a lady that only spoke Spanish, so I had to try to find someone to help me out. So I found one of the sales reps.  Very Mexican-like name,  looked Spanish. 

I discovered that I had stereotyped him,  cause he didn't speak a word of Spanish. Pretty cool dude,  laughed pretty hard about it,  and almost 3 years after I left the call center,  we're still friends. ~~I worked in a call centre a couple of years ago. I'm of mixed heritage (Asian and white) but was born and raised in the UK so I speak with a Yorkshire accent and my first name is Adam so am incognito on the phone. 

I had a customer who for some reason went on a think veiled racist rant about foreign aid. By the way this was not relevant to the conversation at all. I was filling in a questionnaire with him.

The call dropped quickly after I subtly and intentionally mentioned my very Asian last name.~~White American woman here with a kick ass phone voice. There is a state here in America called New Mexico where I once lived and did call center work for American clients. But the problem is sooooooooo many Americans are retarded cunts who don't know the 50 states (shout out to Puerto Rico we love you bitch). 

So I learned quickly to answer ""where are you from"" with
 ""the American south west""
 ""like Arizona, Texas?"" 
 ""Yes""

No bitch, I'm in between the two geographically, but I got tied of dumb ass people asking for an American.~~I wish I could connect people to the correct queue. Im on an English only banking line (we have the option of conferencing in a third party translator though), but each queue represents a different skill. Agents arent fully skilled out until about a year after initial new hire training (so theres queues for cards, basic account info, ach/wires, our website, etc). If a caller smashes buttons or selects the wrong option, theres a chance they will get an agent who isnt skilled here and they HAVE to put you back in the correct queue. However if you are skilled in that area and they come in through the wrong queue, you still have to take the call. This results in repeat callers consistently calling in through the wrong queue. Its annoying since each queue has different handle time requirements, and some skills take longer than others.~~As someone who has to USE interpretation services for important stuff (recorded statements for auto claim liability disputes), I feel your pain.  Believe me me want to ask them to quit interrupting and speak through the Interpreter too (and also to quit rambling but we dont recognize it until theres a 5 min back and forth like someone else described to get a 3 word answer in return) 

I LOVE it when I get a translator who calls the caller out on their BS.  Who will say to me they are going to tell them to answer the question/quit repeating the same thing/quit swearing because they cant interpret it anyway, etc.~~Had a guy tell me ""I am not going to sit here and explain myself to some High School Dropout making Minimum Wage and reading from a script like a monkey!""  So I tell him ""First, I graduated High School and I am three hours away from my degree in Cyber Security.  Second, my paycheck is none of your business but it is far more than Minimum Wage.  And third, while I have to read from a script, I don't follow it because in your case it would take us twenty minutes to get to the point where I know that this is your issue and what I have just asked you to do will resolve it.  If you want to spend the next twenty minutes running diagnostics I will be more than happy to do so or you can apply this update and be on your way in two.  Your call.""  That actually shut him up.~~What a bastard! As if it were *your* accent causing the delay! Motherfuckers who can't speak English, yet insist on using the English line make me sick! Ask for the fucking international help desk, asshole! We are not here to help you learn or perfect your English. Take a class. 

Ok, rant over...seriously though, your boss sounds amazing! I wish I worked for a company that actually cared how its agents are treated. ~~I get this a lot ""thank god you speak English"". I hate any kind of racism so if they waffle on or say something totally inappropriate like ""I was speaking to India before and they're so unhelpful"" (since we have no locations in India this shows how stupid the customer is.)

What do I do? Take their issue then explain ""we have a special team for that, I'll transfer you now"".

Transfer their ass to our Spanish/German line ""by mistake"".

Whoops! ~~Communication being key, I've rarely used the phonetic alphabet for my own amusement, but every once in a while I get a bee in my hair to be difficult.

""P as in Pterodactyl. K as in Knight. G as in fish. C as in cue. Q as in queue. Zed as in Zed.""

I used to have an entire ""fuck you"" version of the alphabet I could break out on customers that were... difficult.~~well if you cant help you cant help. theres not really much you can do there. i think you handled it as best you could by at least trying to get on a level in which they might understand you better. ill be honest; i probably wouldnt have done that.~~","The commenter shares their experience of dealing with rude callers from New York and New Jersey. They also mention that if a call comes in from the 626 area code, they will let it bounce. They also share their own experience of dealing with rude callers while working in a call center."
9.0,"I was in retail for a decade. I was in a call center role for 9 months, then got promoted to a department that dealt with the angriest of the angry customers (the ones asking for the CEO) for 2 1/2 years. 

Went for a training department role where I am now. I dont even have a work extension. Its so glorious. Never will talk to a customer again. The past year has been the happiest of my life.~~It takes some getting used to. 
Depending on the company you're going to work for,  they may or may not provide you with all the resources to take care of the customers,  and if that's the case,  the calls might be extremely stressful. If you've got a decent personality and you can project confidence over the phone,  you'll do just fine. ~~I told my wife if I apply and find another job with similar pay and better environment, I'm not giving 2 weeks.  They're gonna have the option of sending me a shipping label to send their shit back with or someone can meet me at the office that's 12 minutes from my house~~I just quit my call center job as well. That place literally made me sick. I didn't resign until I got an offer for another job but I took a week off in between (first day was actually today)... its amazing how much my neck pain has eased up and I no longer lose vision in my left eye with migraines.

I was at work all today today with a migraine and it was completely tolerable.

I share the same feeling. So much anxiety and stress has fallen away.

I've requested HR send me a label to send my equipment back as my previous supervisor and I do not get along well at all. I have zero desire to speak with him.

Wishing all the best!

Edit because I have difficultly forming sentences today apparently.~~Wow ""Nancy"" sounds like my old manager! Different job field but my dept was restructured several times, each round caused more people to quit. I stuck it in out almost 4 years, was denied promotions/transfers to other depts because management ""couldn't lose me"" in my position which was crap. The final straw was getting told that I was going to 2nd shift after I said that I absolutely could not work anything but 1st shift due to childcare as I was going through a divorce at the time. Management told me to ""make it work"". I was so happy to quit that place.~~From one southerner to another, ""Bless your heart, hun it will be ok."" For some reason people have more balls on the phone then they do in person. Is It frustrating? YES. Does it give you anxiety when they are yelling at you on the phone? YES. Should you take it personal? NO. Take pity on them for yelling. ""Omg! This person is letting a COUCH take him out of his character! This lady is allowing a SAUCEPAN to rule her life and put her in a bad mood. Aw these poor, stupid, irate, dumb, emotionally stunted, ridiculous people.""  That pity will help your confidence grow. Its acting. Its theater. Baby that call center could be Broadway. If you let it. 
Wink Wink. Nudge Nudge.~~A couple of additions to my tale if an otherwise good agent happened to have a bad month, too bad.  You were unlucky enough to get that caller that just wouldnt end the call for an hour, sending your talk time into the crapper?  Sucks to be you.  

Morale also plummeted, with many agents giving notice before it was their turn on the chopping block.~~Know your worth. Because every call center job Ive worked has tried to squeeze every last drop of work out of me for next to no pay and no career path forward. 

Also get ready for constant stream of irate users in need of help. You will come to expect irate users, and they will come to expect a Custer if a service desk. ~~Congratulations!!!! I remember when I got promoted to the Workforce Management Department at my job and the only thing i was excited about was that I didn't have to talk to customers ever again, it's a great feeling!!!! My job has gotten worse over the years and I received a verbal offer at a new company. Almost 50% raise than what I'm making now with less work.~~I quit my hell center job on October of last year, got a software support job on January and changed to a software developer trainee program last week, couldn't be happier. Everyone's stressed and I'm sitting here just thinking about how they don't know what real stress is. Couldn't be happier~~I just sent an email to my supervisor begging to be taken off evening shift, even if it means transferring to another department or a paycut. I stopped just short of threatening to quit. Since I starting this job I've started taking sleeping pills just to have crappy sleep followed by a day of groggyness that I need caffeine pills to get through followed taking sleeping pills, and so one. Combined with WFH this schedule has made be more isolated than ever before. I have no life outside of work andfailed both my classes this semester. I'd love to be back in a job where people just yelled at me and I didn't have to try and sell them anything.~~Worked in a call center for 10 years. The trick is to take absolutely nothing personal. If youre are getting screamed at (and you will) know its not you theyre yelling at, its the situation. My go to move is just sit in silence and let them go. Eventually theyll say are you still there?! Just reply you were waiting for them to finish as you didnt want to interrupt. Worked every single time for me~~I'm the same, I have always worked 'on my feet' kinda jobs cleaning, wearhouse and whatnot. I never thought I would like working in an office environment and I hate talking on the phone. But I have taken to this job so well, I have the top stats in my team and have been working as support for escalations and I haven't even been here a year. I like helping the people who call In and I find it satisfying to calm the angrys. Best of all my back doesn't hurt at the end of the day! (There are some idiots still though but I just laugh at them after the call and carry on)~~Call center jobs always suck at the beginning. You'll get desensitised after a while. Don't ever spend your breaks working though because that's not going to help your mental state. If they don't provide sufficient time to complete your tasks that's on them not you. I have no problem taking myself off the lines for a couple of minutes if I need to finish something mainly because I don't really care if I get in trouble at this stage tbh. If it's affecting you that badly though I'd recommend looking for something new. Call center jobs aren't for everyone.~~It depends on your personality and what kind of environment you'll be working in.  If you're naturally good at speaking and dealing with customer service roles you should be fine, but even with that given if you work at a call center with poor management (lots of micromanaging, bosses stay on your ass for small errors, stupid and poorly thought out policies), or if they don't give you all the help and resources you need, it can be very stressful.

Just give it a shot and try to be positive. ~~I left a call center for a good job, and I dont have to answer the phone. I should but I dont. I have PTSD from working at the call center and therefore I never listen to my work voicemail. Which actually says that they should just email me insteadI dont even turn on the soft phone software on my computer

Edit to say Congrats on finally making it out!~~Theyre calling you because they need your help. If you dont know what to do, calmly tell them youll have a look into the best way to resolve their issue, put them on hold, and *then* panic and ask your colleagues/manager for help.

Also, people might be snappy or angry or upset. Its not personal, theyve possibly already spent hours trying to figure this stuff out. Best thing to do is listen, acknowledge that the situation is stressful for them, then try to start *your* interaction with them on a clean slate of helpfulness. Dont ignore their irrelevant moans like how their dog died on Monday or their car broke down etc; acknowledge that that means their current issue is happening at a bad time for them and then do your best to help with it.~~Call center work is hell. I did it for a year and the stress and anxiety was so bad it made me physically ill to the point I was going to specialists to figure out what was wrong with me. It took 6 months after I quit before my body was back to normal. Quitting was the best ever.~~I feel you. I just got fired from the call center hell a couple of weeks ago. First time being fired EVER. I just stopped answering calls. Something in me snapped too. I lasted a year and a half. Cheers to us for getting out and never looking back. I dont even care that Im ineligible for rehire there. See ya!~~I did a sales based call centre before customer service, I was really hesitant before starting my current role. I'm now just over two years in, I've moved into a role which is the next level of support, so I get less of the rubbish calls, and I love it. Being actively encouraged to tell people ""you would really be better going elsewhere, as what we offer really isn't suitable"" if what we have is not right for them really shows my company cares about its customer base, and I would externally recommend my company to anyone who I thought it was right for because I know the ethos is actually a thing, not just a gimmic. Unfortunately, I do write some shit on this subreddit (99% of which is about my previous sales role), so I need to be super vague about who I actually work for, but it's by far the best job I've done, and the best company I've worked for hands down.~~Hey there, I've been in a call center for over ten years. I'm in the financial services Industry and I make good money I made just over 100k last year. I enjoy the fact that work does not pile up when I am off or on vacation, the calls are relatively easy and the money and benefits are great. But after ten years, I am experiencing burnout and I am currently on a leave of absence for my anxiety and mental health. I wish you well OP, currently I am looking for something different and maybe not involving the phones.~~",The commenter worked in retail for 10 years and was promoted to a call center job where they dealt with angry customers for 2 1/2 years. They quit their job and told their wife to apply for another job with similar pay and better environment. They also shared their own experience of quitting their call center job
9.0,"One of the things i'd personally go for, is to hand them a hypothetical case to describe how they would solve it. If they've been in call centres before, try and have them retell one of their cases where they went above and beyond to help a customer and how they felt about it. Give them something they have to think about, actively make decisions. Brainstorm with them etc. 

I'm fairly certain a good portion of the redditors here would agree with me that the "" good ones "" genuinely care about their customers and are actually very proud of a job well done.  If you've got one of those in the interview you will almost always be able to gather that from their responses. ~~Dude chill, we had a similar opening, coaching is really hard. You have to listen to calls from other people, doing so many mistakes, and there's nothing you can do about it. 

In my Call Center, these idiots spew so much misinformation, if it was about covid we would all be dead. Thankfully it's not.~~If a ""lot"" of your classmates failed, that's a failure of the training staff. I spent two years as a trainer/manager in a call center, and only once did I ever even consider terminating a new trainee agent. She spent an additional three weeks side-seating (""nesting""), before she finally passed.~~Former quality agent here. I picked calls at random that were a certain length. We couldn't evaluate a call if there's only two or three minutes but I wasn't going to stick around and listen to a 40 minute call. 

Don't worry about low scores in the beginning. Just work on getting the basics down and you'll gradually improve.~~Be prepared for a lot of condescending tones, overt racism, and awkward silences after people reveal waaaaay too much about themselves in the course of 15-30 minutes. But keep in mind they will probably look like an idiot who's too proud to admit it by the end of the call. 

Try to remember the call won't last forever and to have perspective. You will probably be mentally drained everyday after work so find a way to *woo-saah* that stress at the end of your day, I personally take this time to myself so that any crankiness from work doesn't bubble over to home before I've had my 30 minute reprieve. 

If the company is worth it, don't let some asshole who won't remember you tomorrow dictate your future. ~~I'm currently looking for another job and yes I've been with my cc job for 5 yrs and I fucking cry before I clock in
I cry between calls
This job is so fucking deteriorating me as a person 
In my cc we have to deal with verbal abuse 
We have to deal with customers cursing and we cant hang up 
So I spend 2 hours per call because the customer has the power to keep being on the line and be horrible 

I'm so sick of this sht 
Some people are fucking assholes bro smh 

I cant wait to quit~~No amount of training will teach you everything you need to know. What's more important than learning everything is knowing where to go to find out the things you don't know. So if it's either an reference library or a manager/coworker know who and what your resources are when you come across an issue and arent sure how to solve it.

Regardless how you feel inside, express confidence over the phone. People can smell uncertainty and that's a big big reason they'd ask for a supervisor or manager. You are capable and willing to help them with whatever, or at least that's the vibe you gotta give off 

And as a follow up, some people will just not want your help and want to speak with a supervisor, dont take it personal, as long as you did what your job says you need to that's all you have to worry about.~~Thats actually very strange. Due to liability concerns a reference giving by a prior employer is very limited. A new potential employer can ask information, but only very basic information will be provided. The reason why this is the case is due to the issue with civil suits.

Companies have been sued for liable/slander as well as damages resulting from lost employment opportunities. This is why any halfway sane HR person will provide only very basic information, such as if you worked there and what you starting and ending dates of employment were. Thats about all they can say.

Only an idiot HR person would say more than that. They've opened themselves up to a massive legal liability.~~When I started working at a call centre for the first time there was definitely a learning curve especially learning to get a back bone and not letting bad calls get to me. I had to learn that the people weren't upset with me, just with the company's policies. I learned better ways  to handle irate callers and my manager and quality advisor were always around to help out when the customer asked for a manager even though they will say the exact thing I was telling them. The hours are decent, pay is decent, and the people I work with are great, making the job much more bearable. Also when you get thanked by a customer or two and they say you're doing a great job, it helps you get through the day. :) ~~I worked at an insurance company explaining to people in their 80s what the variable annuities that they bought were. 


Now I do traffic data collection. Im alone in a truck all day. I set my own hours. Im not attached to a clock.  Absolutely no phone calls required. Much happier.~~I work as a receptionist at an animal hospital. $16 an hour, which is more than I made at any of my call center jobs over the years. They love my phone skills and ability to multi-task at the animal hospital, so I guess call centers were good for something.~~Yeah, I've worked in a call center for 20 years. Sometimes I can get into special projects and get away from the calls for awhile. But I always end up back on the phone eventually, and it is like I'm waiting for the executioner to come put a hood over my head when it happens.

Hang in there, you're not alone. There's millions of us who die a little every time our phone rings.~~About 7 years ago I worked for a center that takes calls for broken down semi truck drivers (not accidents, just break downs). Everyone started at the front line (taking calls) and most of the time is moved on to someone who makes outbound calls to shops within 4 months of starting. I started out working Mon-Fri 7am-3pm (busiest shift). At one point they needed someone to move to a night shift and the options were only me and the only other person on my shift (who I had pretty much trained and had worked beside for probably 6 months). I took the new shift, mostly so my fellow employee didn't have to pay more for a babysitter. After a few months my boss said that I could have my old shift back, because the other employee was getting promoted.~~I've been there.  The repetitive nature of a call center can burn out someone who isn't cut out for that type of job. Keep in mind those guys sealed their fate trying to beat the system.  I was in a call center where it was pretty normal for people to take days off legally for mental breakdowns.  ~~Im guessing you all work for either TTEC or SYKES. Im a current employee of one and former of the other. I feel ya. I asked for just 3 hours off once a month for religious reasons and was denied. The absolute inflexibility in terms of schedules on some projects is messed up.~~Trainer here: first score 52, next will be around a 77, and then youll be in the green following qa.  New hires have what we call ramp, as this is expected.  Take the guidance provided, ask for regular coaching if possible, and it will be fine.

Our QA team will only pick calls with a hateful verbatim, or ones between 5-11 minutes long, for efficiently purposes.

Good luck!~~This is so basic it hurts to read.

I can kinda get having to go to extremes to explain some math concepts - the Monty Hall Problem springs to mind - not realizing that the average is in the middle is so dumb, people with their pants on their head would be wondering what's wrong with them.~~Congrats! I too was someone that stayed in a call center way too long for various reasons and can say finding a better company or just a better job in general for you really will feel nice. The part you said about ""at least I know I can hold a job down"" - I found that mentality is extremely accurate for me. Like I always said if I can work where I did for as long as I did, probably anywhere else I go will seem much easier and better and that's actually held true.~~After 7 years I make about 70k/yr w/ my bonus. I get 6 week + 1 day PTO and will get another week next year. Benefits and the 401k match are great and I honestly don't have the desire to have to start somewhere or something new. Also, now that we're WFH, I could never go back to an office for any job.

But, I hate it with a passion, so I feel a bit trapped.~~My first call center job was like that. They kept piling stuff on us, didn't increase pay, and changed up what we were supposed to do every week. Policies weren't clear or conflicted with each other. Agents would often bullshit the customers to get them off the phone and then they'd call back twice as angry when stuff wasn't fixed and good luck finding notes in the account. Lots of agents didn't leave any. Current one would be perfect if they trained me more and gave me more hours. I'm not stressed selling things if that's my job after all.~~It's your life, your career, at the end of the day you have to do what's best for you. You should however find some way to communicate the 'start looking for a new job' message to your staff as soon as possible (I'm well aware of the difficulties of doing this.)~~Don't worry you'll get used to it. My suggestion is to not let **any** of their comments about the company, other people, etc get to you. Customer service seems to bring out the worst out of people and it does show. If you let the negativity get to you, you'll get swallowed whole. 

Source: More than 4 years in a CC. I'm now working as an IT Help Desk and it's way different but in other ways the same.~~",The commenter suggests that the person interviewing for a call center job should provide a hypothetical case where they went above and beyond to help a customer. They also mention that some people in the call center may not have the necessary knowledge and experience to handle difficult situations. The commenter advises not to worry about low
9.0,"So I had another manager and myself make a recording of us reenacting a couple of difficult phone calls we had monitored in our regular quality audits. One that ended well and one that went really poorly. I asked the applicants to listen to the re-enactments (Although they may have thought it was real) and critique them and state what they would do differently.  I didnt expect them to completely come up with an in depth dissertation or anything, but I do like people who can think on their feet and are self aware enough to identify problem spots. 

I also had a laminated printout with a fake account number, a description of the service the customer had, and a fake customer name and address. I left them in the office with that printout and called them from another room and asked various questions about my account that could all be answered by the laminated printout.

Anyone that made a decent effort at these tended to stick around. ~~It is so cool to read your comments. I always appreciate the call center people. Even if Im pissed at the company, I know not to take it out on the call Rep. I specially love it when the Rep is calm and patient. I have in the past asked to speak to their supervisors to praise the Rep. Does that work at all? I mean, does it help you as a customer service rep in your job?~~I moved into data analyst. Due to amount you deal with in a call centre environment with the customers, the targets having to remember a ton of stuff off the top of your head all helps.

Took a small pay cut to do it but working less hours with a million times less stress and rarely have to talk to anyone on phone. Been at my current place since Feb and had five calls three of those internal asking if my systems where set up right~~so i landed myself in a similar spot when i was still in a call centre. i can absolutely relate to you feeling the need to be by-the-book perfect, to script (if you have one), etc. 
i was the EXACT same. to be honest, i think it really only got easier because i eventually talked myself out of my anxiety by reminding myself that my calls clearly WERE perfect enough that they wanted me in a training position some of the time. 


however, i also kind of got a get-out-of-jail-free card on that one, because shortly after i was becoming more comfy in my role, my team took over our escalations department, so whenever i did happen to have newbies shadowing me or listening in on my calls to note my technique, i got to remind them that our calls are special so not all of the things i do are available to frontline~~I agree with /u/Hyndis.  The information that can be disclosed during a reference check is supposed to be limited to hire date, end date and job title. At least in my state, that is. I would look into that, OP. 

Edit: Get it in writing (or an email) that you were disqualified for the new job due to the reference. ~~I was a team leader in a call center here in Australia for a while.

You should never give a bad reference.

The extent you can do is state ""I am unable to provide a reference for this previous employee"" and then provide their title, start date and end date.

Anything else opens the business up to potential lawsuits.

As for positive references go nuts, although if something you say is portrayed negatively that can also open up for potential lawsuits.~~what kind of calls are the agents you'll be supervising taking? to be honest, i have no idea what working in a security monitoring call center entails. 

off the top, my best advice would be to be honest (or as honest as you can be) with your agents about what you're expecting or looking for from them. set achievable metrics. reward agents who are doing well. if you're talking to an agent who is struggling, try to provide a solution if possible. 

being on the phones is tough, but having a solid management team can make a really big difference. good luck :) and congratulations on the job!~~**Why is the level of employee turnover in call centers typically higher than other industries?**
Combination of reasons (in no particular order): job attracts young people looking for 'temporary work', the job sucks so people move on, working conditions are pretty crappy pushing people out, lack of advancement opportunities/pay rises

**The impact that employee turnover has on fellow employees.** at first it might have negative impact but its par for the course so I've come to expect it

**What methods does the industry use to combat the issue of employee turnover?** None, it's a fact of life which is why call centres are always hiring

Obviously only based on my own experience, work in the UK and have worked in house and for an outsourcer, typically change jobs about every 3-5 months~~The company doesn't have to pay for benefits for the temp employees... They also have the liberty to stop a contract for a temp employee for any (or no) reason, when if they were a direct hire they'd have to go through the proper steps to fire them and they won't have to pay unemployment. ~~The rules were very rigid.  The managers were always totally convinced staff were trying to get away with something.  It was very sexist and age-ist.  I saved up some money, and then there was a day that I knew I'd be very late (my street was not plowed, nothing I could do) and I knew I'd get bad points, and it was so ridiculous that I called and quit.  Send an email for backup.  Best sleep-in ever.  Now out of money again unless I dip into serious savings, so I'm job hunting.  The economy is good so I'm reasonably confident.  Center Manager who wondered why turnover was so high?  *You treat people like wayward children with no value.*  ~~Hello! Worked in a call center that was a vortex straight to the center of hell for five years. I was a part time Substitute Teacher on my days off. Because we worked horrible hours, weekends, evening and holidays I often had a weekday off and would sub one or two days a month in elementary schools. 
When I quit the call center, I subbed full time allowing me time to find a more secure full-time job, yet was able to still earn income. 
I then got involved in not for profit work and four years later I'm a program manager for an elementary education social emotional learning program. It took time , but every step was worth it and I wish you luck.~~I worked customer service in a call centre and I loved the job. I loved being able to help people, to sort out their issues and calm people down. Many of my colleagues had worked there for years. We had a high turnover of staff but the core always remained.~~Hang in there. The Holidays are always the hardest being in a call center. Its always stressful for people so they lash out. And then add in covid and its multiplied ten fold. Breathe, if you need a break, take the hit to your adherence if u need to take five. Its tough and know ur not the only one feeling the heat. 

For me, im marking every day to May 2021 when I will be in Key West, FL for a week. No customers or stats to worry about.~~Other than my boss not having the balls to fire people and just sticking with the worst laziest coworkers we can get, I felt this in my soul.

Ive wondered many times after I leave this job how to answer at the new job why I left without badmouthing it. I don't have an answer~~Wow! 23% pay raise sounds amazing! and not having to spk to Karen's ever again is the dream. I'm sorry they made you time your bathroom breaks before, at least at my current place I just go when I feel like it but I still despise having to login to the phone each time. It's so mentally draining and all you wanna do is sleep at the end of the shift..~~I once interviewed for a tech center, and bombed the interview. I think I ended it with, it was nice to meet you, have a nice life. easily, one of the worst social interactions I've ever had. 

by the time I got home, I had a message on the answering machine that they went in a different direction. I didn't think anything of it. a few hours later, they emailed me offering me the job. I didn't bother to confirm the discrepancy with them. I just showed up on the start date. 

the person who interviewed me had 0 recollection of our interview. it was as if he had never seen me before. I think we both pretended that the phone message never happened. I stayed with them for about 10 years.~~Talk to someone who is currently in the role or who has done it before so that you have a good understanding of what it entails. Then put together some questions regarding the role, or even better, put together a 30-60-90 day goal plan for what you want to accomplish once in the posiiotn. 

This way when the interviewer asks what questions you have, you are able to ask thoughtful questions that show you took a genuine interest and put forth the effort to learn before the interview. Having formulated a Goal plan in place also demonstrates that you are serious and dedicated to the position. I've interviewed and hired and these things always stand out!~~I did 5 years at a department of education call center and was amazed at how people go so far in life.  One call I remember asking basic identifying information to a 20 something year old grad student...""Mom, whats my social security number?!!!""  Then she gets on the line and wants me to proceed without giving the info because her special boy needs his aid right now....ughhh..so glad to be out of that.~~same exact thing happened to me, almost word for word. spent 7 years in retail, left for a call center doing collections for a car dealership, lasted 2 weeks before leaving and going back to my previous retail job. i'm not built for call center work at all.

i also have phone anxiety. i was hoping a call center job would help me overcome it. unfortunately it seemed to do the opposite lol~~I never thought of any time I spent in a call centre as career development - except maybe in a Government Department.

There was a time, however, where I was doing cold calling.

They were a bit coy about what they wanted us to do - set up meetings with the sales staff, or get a 'clean' list of businesses - which they could probably on-sell to other businesses.

I was selling top end office equipment, and was on the whole calling small businesses.  What we were trying to sell was in no way shape or form the target market of the vast majority of businesses I was calling.

When they had to go through some staff cuts, I was put on the chopping block, because I had one of the worst sales records.

My manager said to me 'You don't seem to have taken advantage of the opportunities you have been given here'.

I replied 'What opportunities?'

Any hope I had of not getting fired was gone in that moment~~","The commenter had a recording of two difficult phone calls they had monitored and asked the applicants to critique them. They also had a laminated printout with a fake account number, a description of the service the customer had, and a fake customer name and address. The commenter appreciated the call center staff's"
9.0,"I could only do it for 6 months. Some people loved it, though - and hadbeen there for years. 

I think it depends on the kind of person you are. I'm using to problem solving, mental stimulation and autonomy - none of which exists in a place like that. Ollobrains hit it right on the head. Except this was barely minimum wage work, with crazy inhuman hours and the treatment of the customers - added to the way the management treat you. 

It would be bearable if you got a liveable wage, or regular/decent hours. But there you go.~~Long-term karma sucks for the person it's hitting; but might also help them learn.

A classmate a while back told a similar story of long-term karma. I don't remember which person in the story he knew (either the boss doing the hiring, or the guy who didn't get hired); but the story went something like:

Guy shows up for an interview. Things are going well; but the boss is wondering why this guy looks familiar. Finally, it hits him: this guy was the guy who dumped the boss's daughter a couple years ago in a particularly hurtful way. Sure, the guy was in high school at the time; but still: family is family, and takes precedence over business.

Boss explained why he wasn't hiring the guy in the nicest possible way; but actions have consequences.~~Are you sure this industry is right for you?  I dont mean that as an insult. It isnt for everyone. Im working to get out myself. 

Take your skills and apply it to other industries. Start on indeed and read any and every job description. Compare it to your experience. Email or call the recruiter who posted the job and ask how to get into that industry. Ive gotten amazing leads and even development that way. Recruiters love to hear you took their advice and will short list you for jobs this way. ~~13yrs in call centers and I have found that it is not the customers that will get to you, because once you hang up they are gone from your life. In call centers it is the company politics that will get you. Understaffing, constantly changing rules, dicking with your pay. The best is to keep your head down and roll with the punches.~~I honestly thought this would be a stop off, getting some cash together before I started university. 

Then my car broke down, so I had to buy a new one, and a load of things went to shit and needed paying, so I got stuck paying off finance and loans. Three years later and I can't actually imagine going to university or working anywhere else.

Plus the benefits are fucking brilliant~~Here's my mantra born out of thirteen years in the industry 

""I hate customers, I still love people.""

It got me through some fucking hard days. That said, though. This industry is not going to get better, not in our lifetime. Some day you'll crack. Took me thirteen years of abuse and I am still dealing with the fallout of realising that I hate the person this job turned me into.

Get out as soon as possible!~~Wooo, nice!

I did my time in call centres and eventually my mental health was really suffering.  Got out, got back in to the field I studied for and now have a job I enjoy on 4 times the salary, plus additional benefits.  

The difference leaving a call centre made to my well-being is immeasurable.   

My advice to anybody who is stuck working in a call centre and thinks they want to leave or feels like its affecting their health is just do it, take that step!  Changing jobs can be scary but youll thank yourself.~~The key thing is to talk to your colleagues in that department (which you should always do to prep for application and interview anyway) and find out if the pay-grade is higher or not.

If pay is within the same band as your role you probably wont get a payrise.

Or do you mean change companies but move to another call centre job?

If thats the case it depends on the nature of your work and who you move to. Most call centres have the same pay scales because they dont care about their staff and youre unlikely to get a payrise for a similar role, but some companies (especially huge successful tech multinationals) pay over the standard rates because they want good staff and not phone monkeys who hate their lives.~~As much as I have horror stories, I too work for a brilliant company. They look after us! It's brilliant pay and we're well looked after. I've gone from customer service through to technical support and customer retentions, being up skilled and given extra opportunities along the way. I get a good pay rise for being loyal to the company and it certainly helps that the company just LOVES handing out free cake. There are a huge number of people that have been there for over a decade and most management and senior staff have been there from the beginning and are hired from within the company. I don't think I've ever seen them hire from outside, they just promote people that work hard! So many companies could do it the same and would have much happier (and therefore hardworking) staff!~~you need management experience to be considered for this management job. 

well then... how do I get the initial management experience?  You want me to leave your company, work as a manager for another company willing to give such a position to me, and then come back some years later to work for your company again as a manager? ~~IT department that handles the software I used at the call center. My understanding of the users (being one myself) was only my second greatest asset. The best skill I learned in the call center was being able to identify and resolve issues from context clues, since callers rarely knew what they were talking about in the first place.~~I tried to leave but they reeled me back in. O.o 

I quit my job in December and was looking for other positions in different industries. I have enough savings to live job free for about a year before it gets tight. I applied for every job I could within my other industry but even though I had the skills, experience, and degrees necessary, most other jobs take weeks or months for the hiring process. 

I got super bored just cleaning house and applying for jobs all the time so I applied for a call center position. I was interviewed twice and accepted the job off in less than 30hrs from app submission to offer.  

It's just easier to have your soul eaten man.~~I got a job in the call centres internal IT team, since they were hiring a brand new team and wanted somebody with experience in the company's own systems. After doing that for a while it lead to a job running the tech support desk for a startup which is what I'm doing now~~I did 7 years in a call center after falling for the lies of potential advancement and career progression.   


Now I am a system engineer and have been here for 12 years after spending the first several in support. Its a much better company and actually offers the progression its predecessor lied through its teeth about.~~Metrics are important to an extent BUT most in management arent thinking big picture. For example, you had two days last week where your service level was 50% where it should be 80%. Well my manager at least isnt worried too much about because we are still at goal for the year so far.

I am sorry to hear you got passed up for the promotion and when you dont get recognized for your efforts, it feels like a kick in the balls. Though I will say some companies (I happen to work for a small one) do care about their employees. I want to get off the phones for sure, but there are only so many positions that my company has available.

Metrics should only be one factor when considering someone for promotions not the make or break it decider.~~A general customer service/care role is vital to many industries, but they are not always call-center jobs. I did customer service for a medical device company and it was 7 hours of email/fax order entry and only an hour of phone coverage. Some people were on the phones for longer, but only one person was purely on the phones all day. I am currently in procurement support, which utilizes all of my stay calm and answer the questions to the best of my ability that I developed in a call-center, but it is almost entirely done via email. Ive taken just a few phone calls from internal contacts that I usually email with. 

I imagine you have experience with several software programs, including databases. Those skills (and possibly the programs, too) are almost always going to be a positive (and at worst a neutral) to any future employers.~~Honestly Im still dealing with customers for a chunk of my day but Im also mentoring and supporting a team learning to deal with customers outside of taking inbound calls. Im teaching people to be the hero as well as having the opportunity to be the hero to the customers I still deal with. I thought I would love the part of my job where im writing our sops but its really watching my peeps fly solo and thrive~~Canadian here, paid breaks are mandatory. I worked in a center for 14 years and yea, they just keep piling on the responsibilities but not any more money.  My wage was capped back in, I think 04, and not one cent more up to my resignation in 2013.

If you are actually out, congrats. Definitely go after any money still owed too~~You can say something to the customer such as please wait while i see if the information submits as if you disconnect before this is done then the form will not be valid.Thats what I do and its true anyway because if there's some glitch and the client had disconnected it would be difficult to redo it without the customer there.~~Take what they say at face value.  Always confirm before relaying info. Don't be afraid to say no when you know you can't do something for them. And if you're feeling overwhelmed, tell your boss you need a breather for your mental health -- if they brush you off and say no, time to look for something else.  I've called out bosses for being like that before~~You need to have some _specific examples_ of how you have helped to coach others and improve the way the business runs. Whether that's by improving efficiency or reducing/managing risk.

9.0,"Nailed it. Towards the end of my last job (also work from home for a large insurance company) I had a series of calls that made me have a complete meltdown and smash my headset on the ground til it was in pieces. Im not prone to shit like that but that kind of job really can break your will to the point that you look like a 5 year old having a temper tantrum. Every minute of every day was so infuriating and I had never felt so dehumanized in my life. Luckily that call was the last of the day on a Friday so I could get a new headset over the weekend lmfao~~I did 6 years hard time in Magenta prison tech centers and thought the solution was transferring to a different facility. So I changed to house arrest with iFruit doing tech as well. I realized it didn't matter who it was for or where it was but I'd didn't want to be on the phones anymore. ~~That's how my first day of taking calls was like draining.  I've should walked out my job the first day. I'm also in helpdesk support call center and it's mentally draining.  I've already been chewed out by many callers and believe me it's not going to get any better.  The longer you stay at a job the harder it is to quit because you get use to the money/benefits.  

Everyone's situation is different so I hope everything works out for you.  ~~TBH I kind of like it. But my job is telephone banking, no sales, reasonable benefits and metrics. 

If you do well and can emotionally handle all day every day, it is fine. I used to do well with long lines at customer service jobs, and it's a relief not to have people in your face or a line staring when you're struggling.~~It depends on the type of calls. Inbound is definitely better than outbound for the most part. Hopefully in training they will let you hear what a bad call sounds like. You will learn things that bother you that you may not know yet. I had a call where someone called me a sadist and it hit me harder than most of the dumb insults I get.~~Ugh. Thats tough. Im assuming hes fully aware the company has decided to find every way possible to get rid of him, and hes just given up at this point. 

Hopefully, other than the challenge and disappointment in his upcoming firing, the *rest* of your early introduction to supervision will be great!~~Honestly, it's a tough position to be in. People are frequently sent to my team as a 'last stop' because I firmly believe in sink or swim. I'm a good developer, so on my team you either have the work ethic to get better or you get fired. 

Document everything. Start with a memo detailing either a failed directive (i.e a missed deadline such as the email) but also document coaching that the employee writes comments on and signs.

Currently I have an employee in the second to last step before termination and the last write up included all of the signed coachings and any handouts I gave them to get better. It was 25 pages long.

For behavioral issues such as dress code those should be documented too.~~I've been a supervisor at two major telecommunications companies. We have waaay better ways to spend our time, trust me. Unfortunately like someone else said, we've got people above us who don't understand what you guys do on a day to day basis. That means we are stuck micromanaging things.~~I know exactly how you feel. I was also working from home for a call center, getting screamed at for 8+hours a day. It got to the point I would dread clocking in so much that I would throw up before work. I called in as often as I could to try to balance my mental health but that plus the isolation was really getting to me. I started working at Walmart instead unloading trucks and stocking and it's helped TREMENDOUSLY. I don't have to deal with customers the first half of the shift and when I do they're polite. I've made friends with my teammates and the pay is actually better than what I was getting at the call center. I recommend getting out of there. Mental health is important and there are other jobs that pay well that are much less toxic.~~Yes, yes they do. As someone who used to work in tech support and had glowing reviews from customers but got chewed out for taking too much time and too much effort to help them, I can confirm that metrics are all that matters. But I'd rather feel like I'm helping people than feel like I'm just a drone, so I didn't care if it reflected poorly on me.~~My first call centre interview was sort of semi call centre . It was for a bank , part branch work , they wanted me to answer some  basic math questions  without the use of a calculator because apparently this was vital to the role 
Ok so 1.  
70 divided by 20 minus the answer and the figure X ( not the actual question but you get the jist) is NOT basic math !!
And 2. Everyone in every branch has a calculator!!! Hell there is a calculator on every computer !!! It is not vital that I need to be Matt Damon in good will hunting to work in a bank !~~So long as my job stays wfh Ill stick with it.. however if they force me back to office I'll probably start looking somewhere else. I work for a power company so they generally expect a lot of mandatory OT if storms happen. The company otherwise pays well, treats you well for the most part, the only thing that pushes me to consider quitting is how up tight they are about sales.~~A lot of these comments are pretty spot on, but as everything else it will come down to a hefty bit of luck on your part. Sorry there's no two ways about it. I was always in the top percents when it came to productivity, didn't take bathroom breaks, always helped customers, etc...but it always came down to something out of my control; ie seniority, experience. One time a girl who I helped train and was there for half the time I was got the promotion straight up because they were related to one of the managers.  

Try your best, stay calm in the interview,  but keep expectations realistic. Statistically moving from one corporation to another gives you a better chance of promotion than trying to climb one corporate ladder.~~I work at a cal center in Puerto Rico, where everyone is billingual so we take calls from both gringos and latinos in the US. Since were all bilingual we understand each other in terms of US culture (music, TV, books, american politics,etc) and thats not something that all puertoricans share. Besides that, everyone in my little room of cubicles is pretty cool. Id hate the job if it wasnt for the people. I spend as much time laughing my ass off as I do in calls. Im actually writing this from work, im running on 10 min of available time.~~If I could give you more than one upvote, I would - I also recently moved call centers, and absolutely LOVE the pride I feel for the new company I work for!!  I get to TRULY help ppl now, and for a company that focuses on the customer, and makes sure that I am in good spirits to leave EVERY customer feeling just as remarkable.~~Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, high attrition is part of the call center biz. Pay, monotony and the constant barrage of abuse from customers and/or management are the typical reasons why there's such a high turn over rate in this line of work. An old co-worker from my ISP tech support days got fired for when QA caught and reported him for putting his phone on outbound aux status and placing calls to departments he knew were closed as a way of avoiding calls. ~~Customer service is a marketable skill. Every job exists in some form or fashion because of clients (internal or external). With the little bit that you described of your position, I think you could spin it off as administrative experience and look for office or secretary work.

Also, the Spanish degree can help, especially if you are actually fluent in Spanish (there were people in my school that graduated in languages they could only read and write in but not speak). ~~My place is crap. 8 hours of sitting in a smelly attic with people who just fuck around and shout the place down that you can't hear people over the phone. 15 minute lunch break; I can't even walk to the McDonalds across the street without being late. Shitty equipment; constant faulty lines, broken headsets and chairs to sit on. Since you just asked how it is, there you go. I'm going to quit. However going by your description, I say go for it.~~Both have definite pros and cons.  I think working with medieval times may give you more potential for better jobs in the future, especially if you can work your way up to being one of the performers.  I'd say that will be better for your future, and is the one I think you should pick.~~I still work in a call center (i'm in sales the money is just to good to go anywhere else around here) 
But I also manage a local dinner theatre. Which combines things I love. I get to audition to act and sing in shows, manage the bar and make up all the drink specials (which I theme and name with each show). I get a small staff to manage and just truly try to make the theatre a better experience from start to finish for each guest. 
I love it. It's so much fun to work there. ~~I'm a receptionist in a hospital. I love it. Call center experience has taught me phone etiquette and how to pace myself with a large workload in front of me. Just to stay calm and plow through it. When I first started I was told the phones could get ""crazy"" with about 50\-70 calls a day. That's spread across about 6 of us lol. It's a breeze!~~Make damn sure you know whether or not it's a sales gig. You'll be trained sometimes just to deal with customer service issues and then get pulled out on the production floor and realize you're in a sales position, where you have to make proper sales offers or possibly end up jobless. ~~It depends on the company,  supervisor,  and you. Being an introvert I would have predicted that I'd hate it,  but I didn't. If you have a good company,  good supervisor,  and can relax and handle stress then you might enjoy it.
2 things I found hard: handling the stress of the first few months and handling erratic schedules. When you get better at your job and used to it,  it'll become less stressful. For schedules I had to get promoted for it to improve.~~Because upper management has an insufficient  understanding of what truly drives their business and continues to work on silo model, that fosters the belief that by managing the little things, the big things are automatically taken care of.

If all you see is a nail, the only tool you ever need is a hammer.

Shame that all that excess hammering is actually costing the company money by catering to folks that have figured out how to play the game.~~","The commenter shares their experience of working from home for a large insurance company, where they had a meltdown and smashed their headset on the ground.

9.0,"I got started in a call center in 2017, I was dialing at a  broker for a car insurance company, I sucked at the dialing job and got fired after 2 months and went to another call center selling accidental disability Cover, got fired there too   cycle continued until I end up in client services~~Are you sure you don't want to be a working musician when that becomes possible again, because just think of how much easier it will be to accept the uncertainty of where the next gig is going to be, and to handle the rejections that come with being in showbiz now that you've put up with this shit show.~~I think the best thing you can do is try to channel that frustration into motivation. When you get off work try to really focus on those certs, or something else that interests you. Now that you are gaining customer service experience it wont take much to get into an entry level helpdesk position. The sooner you focus on that and get it out of the way the sooner you can leave this miserable job behind. Your health and sanity is more important than any job, and life is too short to waste it being unhappy. Best of luck!~~Bingo. 

Management is typically comprised of people that dont know or dont care what you actually do. A place I worked at implemented ""the telephone doctor"" system. Besides being a pointless system implemented only by lazy and incompetent management, it also serves as making employees hate their jobs more than they initially thought possible.

Anyways, during the orientation phase I mentioned - ""So...a tech could go all month without solving a single issue, but as long as they (list off litany of inane conversation tactics) they could still get a perfect score?""

When the ""trainer"" and supervisor both matter-of-factly told me ""yes"" I knew that was my queue to start working on that exit strategy.~~I've been there. I went into IT help desk when back pain and the pain meds meant I could no longer do desktop or server support. I hated every minute of it, but put up with it as long as I could to feed my family. I hope you escape quickly and permanently.~~My first call center job was through a placement agency. There was no specific interview for that job, and the placement agency interview was very general.

My second call center job was through the same agency, but it did involve a phone interview with the manager and team lead. They asked me some standard hypotheticals (the one I remember is The phone rings 2 minutes before your shift ends, what do you do?). Most of that job was taking orders that came in via email and fax, only about 2 hours a day were on the phones. Some people had more time on the phones though.~~First of all, you dont just have call center experience. You can use all those skills (other than staring at the timer) in any customer service position. Any experienced face to face customer service supervisor/manager will have mad respect for that. 
Secondly, its an employees market right now. Keep looking and asking around.~~We are in a similar situation right now haha but one thing that helps me a bit is that I start filling out the notes as soon as the call starts and don't let the customer off the line until I'm done or almost done with the note, I usually ask to place them on hold and fill out the notes, but my campaign is not as hard, some days I wait between 20 minutes for a call, another days there's back to back, I used to get anxiety as well because most of the clients are NOT nice but I just go with the mentality of ""these people don't know me, they have never seen my face or never seen me work and they dont know what thus call center bullshit is actually like"" also please take your breaks, they are the only time you get to stretch and forget for a while what an absolute hell this industry is, sending you lots of strength ~~Easier said than done, but dont take anything personally. Theyre not mad at you, theyre mad at the situation. 

When someone is yelling and just going off, dont interrupt them. Listen to what their concerns are. Let them run out of steam. Help them with what you can and apologize/empathize with the things you cant resolve.~~I worked in call centers for about 14 years and my advice is sometimes people just want to vent and it's best to just let them. While they're venting listen for key points and try to resolve what they're calling in for while they're venting. Often times by the time they're done venting you can have their answer and you won't have to place them on any hold.

Also, act confident even if you don't know the answer.~~I once went from phones to being promoted to processing applications and maybe 1 call a week? 

Well my new coworkers and manager decided since I had experience with the phones, I should handle the entire departments calls 

So the new job changed to phones all day AND processing appsI quit a week later~~Only 3 positions at my previous call center job. Phone rep, Supervisor, and General Manager. Smaller center, only about 100-120 reps, 6 Supv, and 1 GM. A phone rep can only get promoted when one of the 6 Supvs quits or (rarely)gets let go. My immediate supervisor was the top agent for 2 yrs(monthly evaluations and ranking) and got promoted. The chances for advancement at that place were few and far between. 

Got out of there! ~~When I worked in a call centre I realised there was simply no upwards mobility. The senior positions were all occupied and updated on tenure, not merit (despite the company touting meritocracy as one of their ""core values"") which also excluded me from enrolling in the leadership program they had, despite high recommendations from my boss and his boss. I couldn't get crosstrained into another role because there was no one available to do the training. Ultimately after failing to complete jump from one team to another I found myself with no position in my old team and no position in the new time, so I got swept up in a wave of redundancies and let go - the alternative was a demotion to an administrative position where I have have had even worse prospects.~~&gt;I walk around the cubicles and I don't recognize most faces anymore

This was why I got less and less interested in my job. I stopped being as social and started dreading going to work (eight years of repetition can do that fairly easily). My job started making me depressed.~~I work in Workforce Management for a call center, and that is the number one priority is to ensure we are not turning people over like flapjacks and giving them appropriate days off needed for psychological days.  I actually don't work with operational management like most people would think because they have their own directive by getting incentives by decreasing additional call outs/ attrition and driving stats whether it be by decreasing AHT, schedule adherence or what have you. Call center work is repetitive and it is a challenge to come to work everyday just to have what seems like the same dumb customers calling and repeating the same verbatim over and over. I feel you and I was an associate for many years. ~~I am surprised to hear of your churn rate, for tech support that pays decently.

At a previous job, a co-worker was caught muting his calls - the customer would go ""hello? hello?"" then eventually hang up. The co-worker stopped showing up for work after he was confronted about it. Our department supported businesses, it was usually IT that called so really I didn't think the job was that bad (as opposed to my first position as residential tech support). 

Personally, it pisses me off if my coworkers pull call avoidance crap. Like working on a school group project and someone slacks off, it's friggin annoying.



~~I've found that the type of people that generally work in call centres are a...

well ""special"" bunch.

A little odd, sure, but easy-going and fun to talk to none-the-less

I've made some great friends in call centres, and speak to a grand total of one of them to this day!

I've also found for most people that

&gt;making friends for me is an effort

is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

i.e. you say you don't like talking to people, so you don't talk to people.~~","The commenter shares their experience of working in a call center, where they were fired after two months and eventually ended up in client services.

10.0,"This reminds me of a scene I witnessed between a hotel guest and the night manager,  who was fucking awesome.  This guest booked using Expedia...and on Expedia,  it says that they MUST contact the hotel to make sure that they can accommodate any specific requests.  In this case, asshole wanted 3 roll away beds. They did not have them. Dude was screaming and yelling about his back and how he cannot possibly sleep on a king sized bed with his wife and three small kids . Ok, I get it.  But there is a hide a way bed in the room for the kids. Nope. Not good enough.  I wanted to tell this guy to fuck off myself, frankly but I kept my mouth shut until he was done throwing his fit.  The night manager stuck to his guns and refused to upgrade them to a suite.. nor would he allow them to stay for free. It was rather awesome seeing this asshole get no reward for his behavior.~~Sounds like A.s father needed to step up, drive to friends location and give friend a ride to pick up passport and then take friend to the airport. The dad also needed to pay for any fees that might have been incurred by friend missing flight and having to rebook because of his little entitled daughter thinking it was ok to steal the passport of a friend, especially a friend that needed it to go see a dying relative.  

I feel really bad for the friend and for you having to be the one to tell her you cant release it to A. Too bad they wouldnt let you release it to A.s dad so he could meet friend at the airport with it or let the friend designate someone to pick it up for them. Sometimes policy sucks~~You don't want FMLA. You need to ask for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. When I worked in HR at a call center, a similar scenario was literally used as an example. And yes, ACW could be adjusted to a ""reasonable"" number. They couldn't completely disregard it, but it could be adjusted.~~Yeah people often dont think about that. My hotel often has ""kids sleep free"" promotions, people book the cheapest 2 bed room online without adding children to the booking info and then make a huge fuss at the front desk because ""where are the beds for my children? What do you mean i have to book a more expensive bigger room, your website claims children sleep for free!""~~&gt; 2. ""Is the room 'in' the hotel?""

This one is valid to me. I have had numerous occassions where I've booked to stay at a hotel and then have found that getting to my room requires me to exit the hotel, walk down the street, enter through some nondescript door, climb up several flights of stairs to get to my room.~~I understand sort of, that most customers don't realize we're not all ONE brick building sitting next to each other in desks. However, that's not the case a lot of times, as we are spread all over the country and sometimes in different countries. Sometimes the other agent is only identified by a number or acronym, and even though we know they talked to someone, we don't know that person. It's like you want to scream, LET ME HELP YOU, when all they want to do is complain.~~2.  Well I guess that depends.  If youre laying on your stomach youd definitely be facing the beach.  If you laid on your side then its possible you might be facing the hotel.  Of course if you laid on your back then youd be facing the sky.  Yup, definitely the sky.~~Rich people are the worst. I take satisfaction in not responding to the dumb shit they say. Listening to some snobby douche laugh at his own joke while I wait in complete silence for him to shut the fuck up and get back to the conversation is a feeling I live for.~~I had the reverse happen as a caller.  


Calling a Vegas Hotel, looking for a romantic getaway weekend.     


""Sorry all the suites are booked that weekend, we do have 5 bedroom villa available.""  


""Errr, out of curiosity, how much?""  


""I see you are member of both the hotel &amp; casino loyalty programs, so only $4999 a night.""~~As other people have said, two words: Reasonable Accommodation wish is a protected status under the ADA (If you are in the United States)

Secondly you are now in the document everything phase. Write everything down, dates times etc. Any kind of correspondence you send keep a copy because you may need it later. 

I am sorry you are going through this but what you are asking is not unreasonable and you should not lose your job over it. It's just HR being the useless department they have always been, and flexing what little power they have to feel important. 

You can beat this, and remember if they get away doing it to you, they will do it to someone else. That may be a tough place to be, but knowing that has always given me courage to push back.~~I booked a room a while back for myself and my two kids - on the booking form it asked how many adults, and as my son was 17 at the time, I wrote 2. Of course, this flagged the system to assume that it was 2 parents and a child, so I had to call ahead to make sure they knew that no matter how close my son and I were, we weren't that kind of family~~Is the room capacity based on sleeping arrangement or on fire code? Reminds of being a kid and traveling with friends to events and everyone crashing in one room, but we had people on sleeping bags on the floor and in chairs and in the beds all to squeeze into one room to save money. I think we told the hotel it was just 4 of us.~~I always hated when a caller would have some slapnuts in the background either telling them what to say, or constantly butting in, I used to get to the point where Id outright ask the caller, do you want me to speak with the person in the background directly? Then if the answer was no Id ask them to ask said person to keep quiet as he/she/it was only making the situation worse, the amount of times the caller would then all of a sudden get the balls to tell the backseat speaker to stfu was shocking.~~In the US you can file a complaint with the EEOC.  I'd also consider chatting with a lawyer.  Remember - no lawyer should charge you for a consultation, only after they agree to take your case and you agree to the cost.

Because they didn't outright fire you and instead gave you what could be argued as a reasonable time to transfer within the company, it is possible they will have shown enough consideration to get out of legal trouble.  Do you have everything in writing?  Try to document the other positions available and their requirements - if every position is going to have the same ACW limit then the transfer notice is still effectively a firing.~~Hey lookit that I ALSO work reservations for a big hotel company (and at work right now, graveyard shift woohoo) and have probably had at least 2 or 3 calls like this tonight. 
People always claim to me that ""oh well the other hotel chains all credit me for 3rd party bookings"" so unless you coincidentally work for the same brand then I'm glad to know those people are lying lol.~~I was working at a call center when the storm hit the New York area years ago

I had a lady call in not so much because she has an issue with her phone but because her power was out and there was two feet of water in her house(she said she was perched on a couch in the dark) and she was scared...she tried other numbers but could only get through to us for some reason

I was on the line with her for more than two hours(I told my supe what I was doing and he green lighted the call)...she was really scared

I don't know if you remember that storm but someone's boat washed up far away from the harbor...this happened on the street she lived on as she described the scene outside

Eventual we lost connection...not sure if it was the storm or her phone died

I still wondered now and then if she made it~~Amazing how people think they're so important that everyone knows exactly what they were thinking of, even if they have no clue. I was there with a customer return as a small store cashier that had a ""no return"" policy. ""ma'am I can give you one xxxxx but without the receipt my hands are tied, management blah blah blah, I'm doing more than they would allow at this point"". I just blame everything on management honestly. Customers don't understand the system whatsoever.


Not sure what's with the lack of comments here, I guess night reading?~~I don't know why people keep talking once you give them the number that can help them. You can't do anything more, and all they're doing is wasting time they could be using to get a resolution and prolonging the whole negative experience for themselves.

Although, I was kind of hoping that you would interrupt her with 'would you like to reserve another stay'.~~I've snuck extra people into a room, but at a normal hotel, it was just one extra adult (3 instead of 2) in a 2-bed room, and two of the adults already would have been sharing a bed. I would never try this at a resort with 150% more adult people!~~Do you follow /r/talesfromthefrontdesk? There are many posts where the front desk folks have a very low opinion of online travel agencies (OTA).

Whether it is an OTA pushing through a reservation even though the hotel is sold out to automatically taking the side of the ""customer"" even though they are lying through their teeth.~~I work in tourism and weve had that a lot too. We clearly lay out our terms when people sign up because DUH its a pandemic, stuff could happen. So we say XYZ are going to be your options if you cancel last minute. Then they call to cancel last minute because of COVID, get mad about XYZ that they agreed to, and threaten to come anyway while infected. Why arent these people getting trip insurance if theyre taking trips in a pandemic anyway~~Anyone new to a call center: NEVER give your full name.

For some reason, boomer men asked for this the most when I worked in call centers. Maybe they don't think about how it's easy to find people online and how many of us have grown up with news featuring violent American gunmen. ""For security reasons, I cannot provide that information."" They'd get indignant and often ask, ""What, do you think I'll hurt you?"" I shut it down by lying that it was policy. 

I'm a woman with a lifetime of seeing angry guys do unhinged shit. I'm not stupid. On top of that, a violent man is (statistically) my most likely cause of death. Customers get scarily, insanely angry. NOPE. It's just a job.~~","The commenter witnessed a confrontation between a hotel guest and the night manager, who refused to upgrade the guest's room to a suite or allow them to stay for free. The commenter sympathized with the guest's situation and suggested that the hotel could have accommodated the guest's request for a"
10.0,"Yes he was an asshole, but also kind of an asshole move from your hotel to hide it in the Terms of Service, it's generally know that noone reads those 100 page long things. 

For the sake of avoiding discussion put a information page about your loyalty page on your website and mention it there. People will be less likely to complain about not seeing that since visiting the site of a hotel is common practice.

&amp;#x200B;

You handled it well. Thanks for doing customer support~~Oof.  As soon as you said ""I'm sorry"" I cringed, you tee'd that guy up to be Very Angry because the apology had him expecting to be denied service.

That guy was a total dick, sorry you had to deal with his bullshit.  I'm glad your manager had your back.
~~I also work in the contact centre of a large holiday camp company and I hear this crap day in day out

My cooker is not working and YOU better come out and fix it!!!!!!!!

Im sorry about that, but Im roughly 8 hours away from where youre staying, I can transfer you to the front desk or if you pop down there they can help you out

IM NOT GOING ANYWHERE!!!! GET OUT HERE RIGHT NOW AND FIX MY SHIT ARSSHKDLSNSNDJCM!!!!!!

Then I just transfer without warning!~~Currently working in central reservations for a certain brand. I get quite a few of these along with:

1. Do I have to wear a mask in the hotel?

2. Why did I get you and not the hotel?

3. Why doesnt the hotel answer their phone? 

4. Im arriving at 3am, I still have to pay?

5. What floor is that room on? Does it face north/south/east/west? It has to be on a certain floor and face a certain way! Im a super shiny member!

6. Why should I book with you and not suxpedia? 

7. Why cant you cancel the reservation I made 15 minutes ago for today?~~&gt;ED: Weve been coming to (my resort) for a decade and things have gone downhill since I dont know when. We used to be guaranteed a mountain view, and its always been a cool experience. I know its not your call, but this is leaving a sour taste in my mouth.

The response I wish you could give: ""I am sorry that we no longer meet your standards. I will cancel your reservation without penalty and hope that whatever resort you choose in the future is able to satisfy you."" After all, we wouldn't want to force him to stay somewhere that makes him so unhappy.~~If he can go home because the TV is broken, WHY is he wasting money on a hotel?!?! 

To be honest there has probably been a couple of times in my life where I have stayed in a hotel in my hometown oh, but it was for work and not to watch TV!~~Lol this reminds me of a customer I had back when still taking calls. Happened a while ago so don't remember 100%

Basically calls in because he didn't get discount applied to his order of coffee. No problem, start looking into it and he didn't fully read the promo online and added an item not a part of it.

Gets upset and starts demanding the discount blah blah blah. Turns down all offers I am able to offer just because he was stubborn and wants the 10% off his order. 

Dude turns down close to the full amount of his current order just to complain and get the discount he felt entitled to... sure take 5$ but turn down what was probably close to 50 

Some people just can't see the big picture i guess lol~~Me: May I have your name please?

Caller: the patients name is xxxxxx

Me: ok thank you, may I have your name please?

Caller: Cant you just look it up in your computer?

Me: No, this is the answering service and we do not share information with the office.

After 8 years of this nonsense Im done. People cant even manage basic Q&amp;A. I could understand any misunderstanding if we didnt specifically say we are the answering service in the greeting, but we do.~~&gt; I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS

Well sir, clearly you don't do you? If it's sold out then it's sold out. I can't magically pull a suite out of my ass to give to you not would I want to with THAT attitude. Why don't you stop being a little bitch and get off my line and stop wasting everyone's time?~~I don't understand why peoples SPOUSES call to complain about something that happened to their spouse. 9 times out of 10 I can't actually do anything to help unless I talk to the person it actually happened to, and the one that it happened to is usually not  NEARLY as upset as their spouse. Just...don't do this. You're their spouse, not their mommy. Let them fight their own battles ~~""Hi I was speaking to Barry and I accidentally hung up on him put me through to Barry please"". We have at least 6 offices, with all phone roles there's got to be over 1000 people you could've theoretically been speaking to. No I cannot transfer you to Barry. You got me. Deal with it.~~Ugh I have to ask for screen shots sometimes, and I have asked my company multiple times for access to an email address that isn't just straight up my first and last name, nope nothing. So occasionally I have to give out my full name to customers so they can email me screenshots, which I just fucking hate doing. My name is not super common, first or last. So I feel like it's a security risk.~~Maybe he wanted a warm transfer and not just to be dropped into a queue. That isn't a transfer in most peoples heads. 

Either way though he doesn't need it. He definitely wanted someone to yell at or was hoping some sort of additional compensation would be given without him having to ask for it. ~~When I worked for a phone company I had a customer like that. In the end I said: Listen, Ive given you these two options, and thats all I can do, so if you dont want to work with me, Im going to have to hang up. He kept insisting on the third (non-optional) solution, I repeated myself, he kept insisting and I said: Well I guess were not getting any further! and hung up. It. Was. Wonderful. Apparently he was pissy about it later but I cannot pamper adults that dont understand the word no...~~I used to travel with my dad when he went on work trips when I was a kid. He always checked in while I waited in the car and then we would go in the side door. I think partly he didnt want to pay and partly didnt want to get caught bringing his kid to work. There was always room for me though. He always had a double Queen.~~Check to see if theres a branch of the Epilepsy Foundation near you or post over in /r/epilepsy. Some of them might have experience with this or similar issues and can point you in the right direction.

We were told that my husband might have some language difficulties as well after his epilepsy surgery and while he does, his job is manual labor so he hasnt needed any accommodations for the delays. Im glad your surgery was successful!~~Oh hells no!  You do not get my last name and you do not get my location.  I have had death threats and we have fired customers and taking out restraining orders against certain ones because of the severity of some of the threats against my colleagues. The first time a new colleague shared the city and state our building is located in I almost punched them.~~&gt;I don't work for Groupon, and it doesn't sound like you can afford it anyway.

I LOVE IT!

I worked in anational music store and would always get lowballed by one customer. I had enough at one point and steered him away, while at the cash register in front of others, saying, ""It looks like you can't afford this. let me show you some of the consumer keyboards instead.""

He stopped haggling me after that.~~The first caller wanted you to order renovations to bring the hotel up to her standards, but make sure to schedule it through your time machine for a month ago so they will be completed before her arrival. Either that or she was hoping for a free upgrade to the Presidential Suite that they keep hidden to save it for the special customers.~~I guess she assumed that if she waited until the 11th hour, you would have a bunch of unsold rooms and would be desperate to fill as many as possible before the cruise took off.

A lot of Dumb People seem to think that way in general--that any service (a hotel, for example) is just sitting around getting increasingly antsy as time passes without the Dumb Person's time and attention, so if they just wait until the last moment, the service will be hopping and begging for some of Dumb Person's meager offerings.

Such people seem incapable of understanding (or accepting, anyway) that a business doesn't live or die on their handful of change, never thinks about that person or their patronage, and could not care less about that person going away forever.~~How do you know if she isnt lying and that the friend is also an imposter. Because dad called the daughter a twit Im assuming youre not in the United States, im pretty sure here in the US if you confiscate a fake or altered ID you have to turn it over to the police pretty much right away and then its up to them.~~This is the worst type of call. I get them a fair amount where I work. Especially as I am female and talking about cars and car registrations. People always think they know more - they probably do about the car details but I don't care. I am here to tell you the process to get your lump of metal on wheels registered and legal.~~Honestly this is just getting lazy with the endless ""understaffed"", if you're understaffed then stop selling more capacity than you can service and don't expect customers to be patient. So I wouldn't defend the hotel if I were you for that.

The rest is frustrating but her way of going about it won't help anyone, typical inexperienced traveller.~~Reminds me of the time I got a call when I was working for a state-run earthquake insurance place here in New Zealand. We mainly covered home/contents/land damages from earthquakes (but also other disasters, with restrictions), but its only for New Zealand properties. One day, I got a call from someone in the south of USA as their insurance company told her to call us after they noticed earthquake damage while performing a Hurricane Katrina assessment. I have no idea how they found us, and why this government run scheme in New Zealand would supposedly cover damage to their property in another country when what we do is pretty clearly explained in our literature, but they called anyway. ~~I used to work at a pizza place in a shit hole city and I had a regular who was a police officer. He never let anyone forget it. When he called in orders he would begin with ""Hi, I'm a Chicago police officer, and-"" He'd place his order and ask about a discount for being a cop. When he came to pick up he would remind us of his profession and inquire about any freebies. He was very nice, but jesus christ that is so obnoxious. I would go through that whole process once a week.~~",The commenter sympathizes with the original poster's experience of dealing with a rude customer and suggests that the hotel should put a loyalty page on their website to avoid any discussion. They also express frustration with the customer's behavior and suggest that the hotel should offer a discount to appease the customer.
10.0,"I mean at least his issue wasn't to insane. My sister worked as a call center agent for a booking website and dealt with some really odd calls where customers would get abusive because she couldn't help them plan vacations to places like Middle Earth, or her favorite- a woman who was adamant they could help her book a flight to Kenya and get her a ticket to take the beanstalk to Luna City 5 (We assume this person read a Robert Heinlein book and thought it was real not sci-fi).~~Ive been the extra before, was with my girlfriends family, they invited me to join them on a trip somewhere, I figured all was legit and fine. When we got to the hotel my girlfriends dad told me to hang back for awhile while they checked in, 

It was only till after when we had 4 keycards and not 5 that I realized what was up. But we got a 2 bedroom suite and an extra cot for her brother.~~My favorite: ""Sir, I've attempted to answer your question multiple times, but haven't been allowed to finish speaking. I will gladly explain to you in detail why this is the policy""

Shuts 'em up every time, and it's not accusatory (""YOU didn't let me finish"") so they don't feel like you're back talking. ~~During Katrina, I worked in a call center, performing CS for a background check company.  My dedicated client was one of the world's largest financial groups--meaning, they needed to check ALL criminal records an applicant ever had in order to stay compliant with FDIA regulations. 

There was a period of of about six months in which NOLA was pure anarchy.  I took to telling everyone in my group what the news said throughout the day, simply because HR people don't understand what anarchy is.  Hence, when people got nasty, I explained what was going on, sometimes literally quoting a news report.  A few people still wouldn't listen, and I struggled not to say, ""Sure, yeah, your applicant nearly died in a massive hurricane, and survived six months of absolute chaos before the cops showed back up, but you go ahead demanding criminal records from a place that functionally doesn't exist.  You are a terrible person, and you take the Human out of Human Resources.""~~I have no suggestions but this has happened to my ex husband and I in the past. Similar situation, except we got no calls or notices until those fees snowballed into $400. Capitol One is notorious for this. We attempted to dispute it but they also wouldn't remove it. She can try building her credit up a little with a different card, I know that's not exactly ideal, but since she has zero or limited history,  one negative mark means a lot.~~I'm in a totally different line of business, but sometimes a customer calls in about a repair, well I'm not the repair dept but I can transfer them, but I freaking hate how some customers won't shut up and have to tell me in great detail on what is wrong with their product.  Uggg!

I do not need to know anything other than just enough to know that I need to do a transfer and I'm silently sitting there thinking please stop wasting your time and my time and just take a breath and allow me to tell you that I have to transfer you.~~I used to prefer it when people would preface their question with this might be a dumb question. I get that, we arent experts in everything.  So I always appreciated when people knew they were ignorant of something that might be very simple.  They were also usually the nicest callers, even if they were needing to complain about something.~~&gt; THIS MAKES NO SENSE!! WHY DO YOU CARE IF MY CC INFO GETS USED WRONG?

This guy is surprisingly cool with the prospect of identify theft.  Though it makes me wonder what he would have done had they rung up hundreds of dollars (or Pounds) in room service and other incidentals?~~RELEVANT INFORMATION: Sorry I forgot to include this in my original story. As I was waiting for a supervisor to get on the line, I saw a previous case opened on the customer's account about 6 months ago noting that he had called our customer service number to alert us to not allow his (soon to be ex) wife to access his account or use any points even though she could pass account security, presumably due to whatever is causing their messy divorce to happen.~~Oh, I will hung up too. Life pro tip: just make sure you do it subtly, like right on the middle when they're yelling, so they realize that  they've been hung up after yelling at the void for a couple of seconds, hopefully even more. I just get all cozy and warm inside when I fantasize about that. Nom nom nom. ~~Im always so curious about how people like this act in their day to day life. Like do they fly off the handle over ridiculous stuff all the time? Do they just get more confident over the phone bc you cant see the person youre talking to? Id love to be a fly on the wall.~~My folks saved up for a cruise as a 40th anniversary present to themselves.  My Dad went even though he had only stopped chemo 1 month before because the chance wouldn't come again.  Trip insurance didn't cover the cancer.  Don't ask.
I can also understand your frustrations.  I worked call center too.  I've been called so many names, yelled at so many times and been frustrated enough to throw potted plants.   
First world problems are still problems.  
It's your 50th time answering the same question, it's their first time asking.    
~~It sounds like they changed their minds /needed the money, so they called in with the tried and true story of a family wedding to force a cancellation. Otherwise, they could have just accepted a new date. I think a new date is what most people would do rather than losing their deposit!

People are irritating and always think the rules dont apply to them.~~The price was ~ $1000 for reservation
Coupon was ~ $200
Caller was charged ~ $800

Caller was upset that they didn't get $200 as a refund AND the overall cost of reservation was $1000 

Then got pissy they didn't get a full refund when they canceled the reservation because they didn't want me to go over the policy which would have stated they wouldn't get a full refund.

I was going to see if I could pull some strings, but they hung up so they're stuck with what they got.

It's amazing how many calls go this way and most agents are willing to work with people if they aren't rude or hung up. ~~I work for customer retention for one of the big satellite tv companies. One of the big reasons people call in is just to find out when their contract ends. This guy calls in to ask this, so just as I'm supposed to do I asked him why. He the says ""Well, I'm about to go to the big telephone poles in the sky. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any contract for when I'm gone."" I was honestly speechless. ~~I know its not entirely in the same environment but i work in a cellphone store and a customer came in being just as vague. He said to me that he was having trouble sending an assignment to someone. So i asked what was the assignment(word, power point, text) and i explain what im asking for. Turns out its just text but he refuses to explain that till i look at his phone. Then when he continues on he wont explain anything he just expects me to send his ""assignment"". after a bit of questioning he turns to me and says ""you have no idea what im talking about do you?"" I said ""nope none"" and he walked out. ~~I could have but it was easier just to deal with the problem. I requested to see his security license so I could make a copy of it.

 When asked why I wanted to make a copy of it I informed him that I was going to send it to the Attorney General's office with a complaint of illegal detention and excessive force. 

He knew that the police would not want to deal with charges but the AG is a whole new kettle of fish. As he had stated he was doing this as a security guard he was under the aegis of the Private security act. Which is under the AG's purview.  Suddenly he was looking at losing his license and job and bonding. He backed off real fast then. 

I worked security for 9 years. His actions really hurt my professional pride.  He thought he could bluff me into backing down.  He thought wrong.~~Even if I didnt read the terms and I called and a rep told me that I would accept it without getting upset. It makes sense, and its on me for not reading the agreement. 

I work in insurance and I get this kind of stuff a lot with people and their contract. Like after a total loss you have a certain number of days in a rental as outlined in your contract. No more, no less. It does not matter if youve been paid or if you agree with the value of your car, you get that amount of days. People think a manager will change the contract and then get offended when I refuse to transfer them (we are allowed to decline to transfer if it isnt warranted).~~Sounds like some of the newbies at my job.  We just spent 6 weeks training you, you have all the product information, and discretion up to a certain dollar amount. And yet they still can't just make the decision to fix the problem for the customer, asking what they should do...~~Nothing is more liberating that just hanging up on these morons, *poof* and they're out of your life. At least for a while, sometimes they call back and can't believe what just happened, that's when it's extra delicious to hang up on them again and perhaps block their number in the phone system ~~I do chats full time and Im in sales.
We have a promotion right now with free shipping on SELECT PLANS, everywhere on the website it says this, but yet I still get messages day in and day out asking why they arent getting free shipping on the cheapest plan.. bruh, the plans state which have free shipping and its not the cheap ones.~~I get that question a lot. The majority of people are just trying to make small talk (95 percent of the time about weather) but Ive had people near my area try to make advances and ask for my number. Ill usually just tell them the only way they can reach me is through (insert our hotline line here). Theyll either hang up or get the hint and move on.~~Working for a telecommunications/ISP in Europe and we do not give any personal information out. It's scary when customers ask that kind of information like. ""What's your name?"" So i give then my first name and my shortcode for the company and than they reply ""Name what?"" Fucking no am I ever giving my second name. It's interesting when they start to demand it and get so frustrated for it too. Cop the fuck on like... No way in hell am I giving you my second name. Nor location.~~",The commenter's sister worked as a call center agent for a booking website and dealt with some odd calls where customers would get abusive because she couldn't help them plan vacations to places like Middle Earth or her favorite- a woman who was adamant they could help her book a flight to Kenya and

They would even list the wrong city in their mailing address. Apparently, once upon a time, someone had tried to come to the office to get their program fixed and it spooked the right people. 

We only ever had to provide our first name to callers, but somehow a customer had figured out a co-workers full name and messaged her on fb to ask her out. She got a paid week off while the company did their best to further secure our identities. I quit shortly after for unrelated reasons, so not sure if the new measures were effective.~~I had a call once where the lady told me she wanted a room that would hold her, her husband and their five children. I found a three bedroom suite that would accommodate but she wanted a room with only two double beds. When i explained why I couldnt put her in that type of room she started yelling at me and said I was discriminating against her for having many children. I assured her i was just following fire codes for that area, but she yelled at me for about 6 solid minutes and said I was personally discriminating against her about ten times. She also told me about how she could sue me and win because discrimination is illegal. She even went so far at to ask me for my name and home state! lol. 

I notated the call and put it out of my mind, until a week later when I was pulled into a zoom call because she had called back in to complain about my discrimination.

Some people arespecial.~~I work in reservations for a hotel company and I get that so many times a day as well.

Them - I'm on your website and it's says X hotel is sold out tonight so I thought I'd call to double check

Me - Yes the website is correct. X is sold out

Them - So can I book a room with you over the phone?

Me - The hotel is sold out. There are no rooms to book

Them - What if I go to the front desk?

Me - They'll tell you the same thing. There are no rooms available. I can book you one of our other hotels nearby instead

Them -  No I wanted X. It's so unfair *hangs up*

What part of ""Sold out"" is so difficult to understand?~~I dont know where you work but on the UK this would be failing to make reasonable adjustments to allow someone under the Disability Discrimination Act maintain employment. They wont be able to sack you and you could get compensation for them trying. 

Check the laws in your area and speak to a union rep or lawyer.~~I work reservations for the most magical destination in Florida. I once had a Guest argue with me that I should give her a discount on a room if she checks in at 6pm because if she doesnt reserve it, it will be empty and why should she pay full price??

By Guest I mean Travel Agent. And yep, many people pay full price just to have the room after a late flight just to get an early start at the parks in the morning.~~Oh lord, I had this last night with a woman who, I swear, talked at me for an hour over two calls. I get she had concerns, but no matter what I said she kept coming back to her main concern while also rehashing things she had already said. And one of her complaints on the 2nd call was she hadnt heard back from someone who said they were going to call her in 10-20 minutes and it had been 30 and they said theyd call and hadnt called, why hadnt they called, they should have called, and no matter how I tried I couldnt get her off the phone so I could call them to find out why they hadnt called until by some act of god someone did try to call her and she asked me to hang up so she could take the call. It was exhausting~~Ugh, I worked for years in customer service, some of which was on the phone. I hated the rude ones.  


I've tried really really hard to be as kind as possible when I'm the customer now. It makes me sad because when there's been difficult issues, I can hear the CSR bracing themselves and then they're really shocked and taken aback when I'm not mean. It's really disheartening to be honest.~~I had an elderly man call up to cancel his wife's cell phone because she had passed away. The problem was, her cell phone was a company phone for a company that may or may not exist anymore (the woman had been paying for it herself for years). According to cell phone company prophesy the account manager would have to cancel the cell phone. I told the man this, expecting him to argue. He responded saying ""I don't want the hassle and I'm not going to be around much longer, I'll just keep paying it"". I felt like shit, I decided to hope that that wasn't the call being monitored and I closed the account for him. ~~As an advice for next time, because a lot of short tempererad people don't even listen to you especially when they're upset already, is that you should NOT say ""I'm sorry but""... Say YES one moment please and transfer them straight away.

Because

 1) you will help them (not just you personally) and

 2) you say YES instead of ""no/sorry/but"" coming off as negating/going against the wishes (again bear in mind they just want to book and don't listen to you properly)

3) also this is specifically American and to a minor extent British, but no need to be extremely apologetic or sir this sir that. Especially if they're assholes ~~I feel this in my soul. Today I had a weird caller like this too. I asked for a verification of his identity and he gave me one so I checked and found nothing. I asked again and he changed it then 30 seconds later was like oh never mind the first one was correct. These people really think were dumb sometimes I swear.~~I worked at a large amusement park on a lake in Ohio; it was a fun summer while I tried to figure out what was next for me. The #1 most asked question, verbatim, was ""hey, what time is the ten o'clock laser light show?""

Once or twice I indulged myself and replied ""ah, it was at ten am, sorry you missed it. i think there's a second performance tonight though...""~~I think you handled it just fine.   You weren't rude. He was.

I had to call a ticket agency 3 days ago when I didn't receive my tickets to a concert the same night.   I was frustrated and afraid my son would miss his first concert. I know the person answering my call wasn't too blame and because I read this sub I made sure not to act like some of the callers I read about. (Ever though I don't think I did before.)

The man who answered was very nice and chatted with me about other things while he was trying to figure out the problem.   In the end,  I couldn't get the tickets I ordered but I got better ones with no additional charges.~~I'd have hated to get my family of 6 excited about a cruise and boat ride we're taking and then find out through some sort of miscommunication or small error that - woops, we're just getting the cruise guys sorry!

It's good there are spots available later but still... these people are paying good money for these things. 

I take calls, I understand how our customers can seem spoiled and bratty but seriously I think for the services you provide - and the money involved - there should be at least a LITTLE more empathy for the situation. 

Spoiled and bratty is when the customer wants what they don't deserve, she fully deserved all of that. ~~Lmao. I'm amused by this but it's really sad how poorly educated some portions of our population are. 
I know people who would act like the caller and it really comes down to being raised in shitty environments as a result of systematic oppression. They just don't understand aspects of society that are basic to the more fortunate. It doesn't make them bad people though.~~I work at a call center for a store that sells overpriced boxes and organization items. We've had a guy call/email us at least six times a day in a belligerent fit of rage because our Florida store is closed and he ""desperately needed a box because he's moving"" and then he demanded that our managers ""drive that thirty minutes in traffic like I (he) did and see if they want to hang themselves like I (he) did"" Like, dude go to Walmart and quit being such a diva. ~~I work for a very large ISP on the business side. I frequently as in daily speak to customers who couldn't be bothered to read the contract they were signing. A legal document that tells them what they are getting at what price they are getting it and where we are sticking it. It's four pages long, that's it really for the most part you only really need to read 2 pages of it and people still can't do it. ~~Wait. I thought Communism is great. LOL. That's where our country is headed. Take it as a compliment.  Plus people are crappy to you on the phone just like they are here in Reddit sometimes because they are ""anonymous"". Just let it roll off you like water off a duck's back.~~Its not FMLA you need, it's an accommodation under the ADAAA that you need. You were denied FMLA because your situation does not require a leave of absence, or missed hours. An accommodation under ADAAA could potentially get you what you need. I actively help people set up this kind of stuff at the call center that I work at.~~As someone who travels with a wheelchair user- Do they have ANY idea how hard it can be to find accessible rooms available? Like, I went to book us a room for a conference the day the hotel opened the bookings for it, and couldn't get an accessible room because they were already sold out an hour after they went on sale. SMFH at people throwing tempertantrums. Be glad you don't have to use one. Having once had to make it work with a regular room and a wheelchair, never again.~~So, I agree the customer was a raging cuntosaurus who screwed herself by canceling and pissing off the one person who might help. 

That said, I have to wonder what the point is in using a travel agency if they don't even do basic vetting of the facilities they reserve for you. If I can google the places and find all the info myself, why would I pay a commission for an agent? What is the advantage when the agent then turns around and denies all responsibility for issues that arise, stating that I could have done my due diligence and looked it up myself? What am I missing here?

Edit: I see now that OP doesn't actually work for a travel agency but a search engine like fuxpedia. My questions are all moot.~~","The commenter used to work for a popular web-conferencing company where they were told to use the name of the popular city next door.

10.0,"Working for a bank, I can tell you right now that the credit card company will only keep referring you to the credit bureaus to dispute the ding on her credit reports.  Instead, I would suggest having her get a secured credit card to start rebuilding her credit.  It will take time, but with a limited credit history, this is the best way to repair the damage.  


Not the immediate solution you were hoping for, but it's the best advice I have given the situation you describe.~~Your manager sucks.

They exist to take those calls, any they're empowered to respond appropriately to those callers in those situations.

You get paid to assist people, not to be abused by them, and if your manager isn't backing you up, they're not doing their job.

Talk to them about that. And if they don't change, talk to their manager.~~At least they didn't just show up at their intended hotel on their ""new"" date and the front desk staff have deal with him in person. There have been posts in /r/talesfromthefrontdesk where people can't seem to understand that what they put into the web site is what they get, especially if they book with one of the OTA such as Oriceline or Expedia.~~My guess is both of them are douchers. If your boss was half as smart as I think she is then she wouldn't care if she lost customers like them. Good riddance to bad rubbish.

Not to stereotype but I swear people from NY that I get in tickets are **the pissiest bitches**.~~When working from home what do you do to change the monotony of possibly not leaving the four surrounding walls for days perhaps hours.

I know streamers who talk about dog walking three times a day to keep or at least maintain their sanity, but if you don't have a dog to walk, it's too easy to retire in front of the tv or game.  Pub and dining out isn't always affordable.~~Actual call Ive head (some liberties taken but you get the idea):

Customer: How do you people expect me to pay for this when it doesnt say how much it costs ANYWHERE?! Ive read every page of this document!

Me: Prices are on Page 2.

Customer: But it doesnt *SAY* that I *HAVE* to pay, so technically, I shouldnt have to.

Me: Page 1 it says, You have to pay.

Customer: But it doesnt say WHERE to mail it to, so I cant make my payment so I wont. You people really have no idea what youre doing.

Me: The mailing address is on Page 3 under a big bold header that says, Where do I mail my payments to?~~I always keep emails like that.  I just booked my first hotel room (going to Kansas City for a Sabaton concert) and I kept that email, and for any concert tickets I buy (Ive bought plenty) until the paper tickets show up-what can I say, Im sentimental.  Same goes for Amazon order confirmations, shipping announcements, tracking info and any and all communication.  I just want to cover my ass~~Oh this is the best. Especially when they get furious about wanting to talk to the same person but didn't bother to remember the person's name. Or ""I already gave someone else my info so you should have it even though I'm not going to tell you any details about myself.""~~I bet he stormed out of the hotel without telling the front desk he wanted a refund. Which sounds like it also needs to go through them. Hes gonna be pissed when he realizes that he aint getting a refund. 

Its funny the things people think we can fix over the phone. I work in insurance and have people calling screaming about an accident they just had, Ill ask if they want to speak to claims to file it and they get more worked up yelling more about how its not their fault a few times customers have said, but it was snowing when I hit them...right, but you still hit them. So youre under the impression that its not at fault as long as it has or is snowing? Thats not the case that just means you were over driving road conditions.~~I feel like this is a huge violation of americans with disabilities act. Esp with a doctors note stating why some physical attributes are slower after having BRAIN surgery. 

Like how ignorant do they have to be!? I am so sorry you are going thru this. It seems you are not appreciated there. I have back issues and my company gave me a standing desk so i didn't have to sit down all the time. I hope you find the same.~~You need to get a lawyer now. If only because they can file an injunction against the company to prevent them from firing you. You require a reasonable accommodation. The extra ACW time is reasonable. It's not like you're abusing it. Once the injunction has been filed you can fight them on it.~~What is to stop you from just booking a second room at the going rate.  There shouldn't be any penalty for that.  I an understand a penalty for wanting to add a second room at a secured lower rate, but charging penalty when they are wanting to spend more would just be stupid.~~I have no patience for this type of gish gallop. I interrupt as soon as I can, on the first problem, no matter how tiny.

""Online hotel booking is done on a computer, this is a phone call. Now that I've solved the root of the issue, was there a specific reason for your call?""~~Obviously nothing you can do at this point for this customer. But is your companys reservation staff and/or website proactively addressing these issues at the time reservations are booked? I mean Joe Civilian isnt thinking that theyre going to get lower quality service because the service industry is going through hard times.~~I had a couple of calls like that, one guy. I can't remember what brought it up and told me he'd just left his wife.

I do the whole I'm sorry to hear that spiel. But he was trying to get a phone for his daughter so I'm actively trying harder to help him out. (After that announcement his depressed tone made what was left of my empathy come out).  Then this happened:

Me: Probably something about what I'm trying to do or a phone. 

Him: Thanks for reminding me I'm not home anymore. 

Me: Oh sh... fu... s-sorry. I didn't mean to.

I'm not sure, I think he was trying to make a joke. But damn, after so many calls where there are fighting spouses trying to turn off each other's service, dead grandparents, and other not good things. That one tripped me up just by the tone of his voice. ~~In my call center i've actually told a few customers when they ask why they have to pay for x y and z. ""Mr/Mrs Customer there are other people who have been a customer of our company for just as long if not longer then you who pay the same amount for programming. And they pay the same fees for these situations and present the same options as you. Eventually you have to pay what the product is worth and these are your options."" I love busting their chops and bringing them down to earth, he world doesn't revolve around you and you're nothing special, everyone pays the same fees. No one is getting anything more than you. ~~I love when people insist on interrupting me. I just wait until they are done and ask them if they are finished speaking. They always ask why I'm asking that so I tell them that my parents raised me not to interrupt people because that is rude and disrespectful and I don't want to speak unless they are finished and its my turn. ~~&gt; I mean, when have you ever called an 800 number and not gotten a call center?

I have a tollfree number that converts to my cellphone. Tollfree numbers are basically just redirections, they can redirect to whatever number you want. Admittedly, it's mostly used for call centers, but not always -- a lot of enterprises with just a front desk or an IVR have tollfree numbers, especially here in Canada since the only cost is per-minute, no basic monthly fees, so if you don't get calls on it, you pay nothing... have a tollfree number is often more about having an air of legitimacy or professionalism. I have one just to show off. :p~~Same here in BC we can reject customers if they are being pricks to us. Such a wonderful thing when you tell some asshole that you're denying them service cause they are being rude and I have that right as a worker in this province. Their look goes from pissed to confused to pissed again. You cant do that!... Yes I can now leave or I'll call security. Gotta love BC~~I've always said the hardest part of working in a call centre is understanding whatever the fuck the customer actually wants. Some people ramble on vaguely about their issue, or flat out say something that defies all possible human reasoning and logic. There is a happy part, and that's when you finally understand the reason for their call. Too bad it's 20 minutes in and your AHT for the day already sucks...~~I hate dealing with muffled assholes.

I had one the other day whilst troubleshooting some software. The software was clearly not installed correctly so I suggested we reinstall that's when muffled asshole spoke up to the lady on the phone with me:

""That's fucking pointless tell them I already installed it""

""No we are not doing this its a waste of time""

""This will be the most pointless thing ever I'm telling you""

""Look it's going to take fucking ages this guy is stupid and doesn't know what he's doing""

""Great he's starting he install which is exactly what I just did. Thanks for wasting out time""

""Oh I can't remember selecting *that option*""

""...""

""Oh shit I can't believe that worked""

All the while I was struggling to resist asking the lady on the phone with me to tell her idiot friend in the background to stop running her mouth.~~I just don't understand people like this who ignore the fact that a family has just been through hell for personal gain. Those poor kids were probably terrified and just wanted to get somewhere they thought was safe, and I don't blame them. I hope the next guests this guy gets are the type that know how to scam these hosts, and that he gets what he deserves and it costs him several times what refunding these poor people would have. ~~I work sending text messages to customers and they reply back, sort of livechat style.

One question is ""Can you confirm your name, full address and if you're the account holder?""
So many people just give one thing to this. Just their name, just their address, just ""Yes"". It's unreal. Why can't they read?~~I used to get people like that at my call center. My project was card services but people would call us about loans or other stuff at the same bank they got their card from, and they never wanted to talk to their bank, despite the fact that we had literally nothing to do with their loans. Luckilly we could hang up after warning them that we cannot continue unproductive phone calls. ~~",The commenter suggests having the customer get a secured credit card to repair the damage caused by the credit card company.

10.0,"So to clarify.

Y = original price, X = price including coupon?

So coupon + Y = X?

I'm not sure what her issue was, was she not happy that she still had to pay X, or was she confused that the bill said X was the price when in the details it said it charged Y?~~It still baffles me the lack of common sense we have been experiencing the past few years. Every year gets worse. Every year people keep getting dumber. You gave her the option of gladly helping her and she decided to complain and report because her lazy ass didn't want to repeat 3 sentences and a name. I'm sure she called back in about 2 hrs after and completely disregarded the whole incident, only to repeat the information and get her reservation fixed.~~When you say you are taking little longer to write up your notes after a call how long are we talking about? 

If it takes you awhile to write your notes you should consider taking the escalation team job. You would get to keep your benefits. From my experience escalation positions usually allow more time for after call reporting.

Edit. Definitely discuss your options with a lawyer and discuss what reasonable accommodations they could offer you. Be prepared that reasonable accommodations may not include doing the same job.~~Companies like this suck royally!! They only care about their bottom line.  Hell, it could be something that happened at work to injure you and if it made you a little less than stellar than you were before they'll screw you over.  It's ridiculous and disgusting and shows nothing but greed.~~Maybe take the position to keep your pay and such, and use it as a buffer while your look for a new job. I feel for you I lost a job a few years ago Im kinda the same way but really it was a blessing. I was scared as Im sure you are but it got me back out there and I was amazed how many awesome jobs ide missed~~Well I don't read terms of service, almost no one does.

The problem here is: how did he found out that there is a credit/affiliate thing? Every place where that is advertised there must be an asterisk with little letters clearly stating something in the lines of ""remember that according to our terms of service, blablabla"".

Now if the person did not read the single phrase in the little letters, then it's a worse excuse than reading the 10s of pages of the full terms.~~Yep, if it's something I care about such as bills and stuff, I will at the least skim each section. Anything that catches my eye I will then read in full. 


Only ToS that I don't really read is for stuff like video games where if you want to play it you have to consent anyway. So if I bought it, then who cares at that point.~~I have a theory that about half of people who phone in to call centers are too dumb to understand their own thoughts, and just need help. Example:

Cx: ""My statement has two numbers on it- $5000 and $6000- which one is my balance?""

Me: ""The one that says 'Balance' next to it""

Cx: ""So it says here 'Balance- $6000""

Me: ""Yep, that's it""

Cx: ""So what's my balance?""

Me: ""$6000""

Cx: ""So this other number is not my balance?""

Me: ""No. Anything else I can help with?""

Cx: 'Yeah, what's this other number? Is that my balance?""~~I work the same kind of job (possibly for the same company, mine rhymes with ""Chariot""). I get a few of these a week. I can see in the reservation history how they booked it - and 9 times out of 10, they did it themselves on the website and have no one to blame but themselves. Explaining to customers that they've utterly SCREWED themselves and there is NOTHING I can do about it in the most professional way possible is always a joy.~~My last call at a call centre I worked at a few years ago . 

Customer : Wow you finally picked up I waited so long to talk to you 
Me : it says here you waited 5 seconds ..
Customer : excuse me ? , please transfer me to someone else 
Me : wait 5 mins on hold and then transfer them 

It felt so liberating being able to talk back to someone and not have to give a shit about my livelihood being affected~~I mean, this one wasn't on A's father. Surely he could have done something else than jus being mad at his daughter, but that was his decision. It wasn't his mistake so he didn't have to own up to it.

I really expect A's friend to cut ties with her. You say stealing IDs is really common and I do think that's horrible.

Me: *Presses mute and sighs*~~Oooh yeah, I had a guy flippantly say he would ""bomb the call center"" if I didn't handle the dispute in his favor. I was so blown away I put it in our team chat (person was over 300 miles away), and I was just like ""who says that??""

I ended up having to delete everything I said in the chat, filing an incident report with security, and they sent cops to his house.

At least now I know the protocol.~~I used to work for a vehicle breakown recovery service in the UK. It wasn't a terrible job by call centre standards, but was sales based so ultimately soul destroying. I left after 11 months, and the next month got a free membership sent through, which was a perk after working there a year. I assumed it was just a quirk and would go away. It's been 4 years. I still get annual free staff renewals, and a new card every year.

Another guy asked us to turn off his cell tower because he has radio waive tinnitus.... Yeah... I told him to consult his doctor.

They actually sell paint that blocks radio wave frequencies. Hella expensive but that's that dude's problem.~~This is a good example of why ""insider"" terms should be avoided when speaking to a customer. Most of the time the additional information will be irrelevant to them and will cause confusion making your calls longer and more irritating; it's a lose-lose situation. A simple ""Let me look into the account"" &amp; ""I see the problem' will serve you better in my experience. Regardless, this still doesn't excuse the customers poor behavior.~~People like this are simply vomiting out their own insanity onto retail and call center workers (and others), IMO. How would you react (or what would company policy be) if a customer came up to you and vomited all over you? You'd get the hell away from them, right?! Now, verbal vomit is a little less vile, but still, more call centers should have policies against even listening to these type of people until they get their own shit together.~~This though, one one hand since I've started doing calls I'm a lot harder to upset than I used to be but on the other hand I have so much less tolerance for bullshit and genuinely incompetent call center people piss me off so much more than they used to. ~~My great-grandmother is 80 and illiterate.

Great.~~In all fairness, this isn't really a case of why people hate call centre staff - it's more why they hate their ISP.  Admittedly, the call centre staff are usually first point of contact, but they are so far removed from being able to affect how their company does business, you may as well be asking a worker drone bee to grow different flowers to gather pollen from.~~My favorite is ""I'm trying to access the website but I don't know my username/password""

""Okay, did you click the forgot username/password link?""

""No""

""... Do that.""

Or people just generally have website issues and I ask if they can go to the website to recreate the problem to read off error messages ""I'm not at my computer anymore"" .....ok.....~~I get what you mean. We handle inbound calls for independent businesses and a few are tech related. Calling in because you want an app removed from you phone (that can't be removed because it comes WITH the phone) is not something we can help with. Trust me, I'd remove the bloatware shit if I could too!~~&gt;didn't shut down the computer for 3 years

Holy dam. I remember the late 90s my cousins had a computer way before we did, and they had a rule to never restart it cause it took forever to come back up. Understandable for the time I guess, even my parents pc from 2006 would take a good 10 minutes to load up windows 7 (upgraded from xp) before i got them a new one. 

But *dizam* thats still a long time for the computer to be up. Only time I saw that was when I worked for a remote it support company, some laptop was plugged into the power and left on a shelf for 6 years as its uptime was 2462 days. Needless to say it was **missing** some crucial updates.~~I had to deal with so much of this when I worked for a mobile carrier. ""All I do that uses data is use Apple Music and watch YouTube, there's no way I went over 10GB. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying."" I told him he could see how much data he's using with our app but that's too much work for him. They expect to be able to use as much data as they want and then call in and get all the extra charges taken off. ~~I get that with payments all the time. Either they got a fee from the bank because of our payment (we don't charge fees) or the bank returned their payment and they always refuse to call the bank. It's always ""well the money is in the account"" and I'll say ""sir or ma'am, that may not be why the payment returned. You'll need to call your bank and verify what is going on. ""

9 times out of 10 they just ask us to run it again, it declines again, and they threaten to sue us instead of just calling the damn bank. ~~I work in a call center and while we get shit on a lot, must of us genuinely want to help and that's really nice to ear that some of the effort we do, do really help people, I'm happy you had a nice experience and those feedback are always super appreciated because it really is a really ungrateful job sometimes! ~~Used to work for a major telecomunications proveder; phone, internet, satelie, mobile, uVerse for any or all three. Harass, threaten assault or otherwise annoy a tech your account or even area could be noted that anytime we send theres a tech and a manager. Do it again you become red dot right away meaning we dont send. Well test from here but if you have dial tone to the MPOE, oh well. Sucks to be you, or your neighbor. 

Then the calls; Some sre so consistenly rude, abusive, verbally harassing that we wont take your calls. Theres a legal process to get either noted. 

Some people were both.~~Reminds me of a customer I once had when working for a wireless carrier. He was angry that he was able to make calls, but was constantly missing them. Turns out, he was only powering up his device when HE needed to make calls and then turned it off after to conserve battery. He just assumed that incoming calls would somehow turn the phone back on when they came in. 

Still not sure how he came to that conclusion.~~Not a call center rep; I am annoyed when calling about internet outages and the questions are, 
Are you calling from a VoIP? No....and the internet is down I couldn't.
Does any device in your household connect to the internet? No.....there is an internet outage.
Is your modem/router plugged in? What? Yes of course.

Then I remember there are people who call and one of those things IS there problem and makes me feel bad for the rep then being annoyed at thier stupid questions. 

And reminds me that time my dad got called to service a wireless printer because it wasn't working when the only problem was its power cord wasn't plugged, ""But its wireless"".~~I feel you. I work chat too and I get the people who come in with, ""Where is my order???"" I get the order pulled up, go to USPS.com and see it was delivered. 
&gt;I see that order was delivered today.

&gt;Oh. I haven't checked my mail yet.

Wth? Go check your fucking mailbox dicknuts. ~~I miss my old call center job working through a contractor for Sam's Club. Great managers and coworkers. Customers for the most part good. That contract moved to Houston and it broke my heart. Then I worked for Bank of America and that was living hell. So I know what you mean~~My first call was in mobile insurance. I stumbled my way through it, the guy I spoke to must have took pity on me because he asked me to get a manager and told him what a delight I was and how well I did. That then got emailed to the entire department which was a lil embarrassing but it was my first call centre call and it was definitely memorable!~~I did tech support in the early days of the internet for AOL. That was so difficult! Not only was the internet new to people, but many hadn't really used a computer before. I remember close to the end of my time there, I was very pregnant. Like gave birth a week later. I got a call. Started off normal. Guy was old, but not cranky. He just wasn't getting what I needed him to do. 10mins in,  figured out we had to do something specific which began with right click on the start button. He couldn't figure it out. About 10mins later, I had to pee. 20 more mins of trying to get this fucker to right click on the start button couldn't hold it anymore. I had to put him on hold and run to the toilet yelling for a manager to help him. They were still on the call when I got back.~~Like you mentioned, there are terminals that have wiring that service 4-8 houses each. Drop wire has to be run from terminal to each house. Yes, that sometimes does involve digging. 

People go fucking crazy when you say you have to go into their yard to access the terminal for a neighboring house.

....the terminal is company property so we do have a right to use it....~~Ah, so she's the ""if I didn't pay and it still works, they must be giving it to me free"" kinda person. 

The fact that corporate never foresaw someone simply never ""hanging up"" for 3 years instead of adding a step to ""manually kick"" someone at end of billing period at time of disconnect though... Tsk, tsk.~~One day I got tired of that bullshit. It's in your computers line. So I was like. Well I don't see you. 

Well find it. It's in there 

Ok I'll just start reading off addresses until I find you. Is that ok?

Sure he said, thinking I was bluffing. 

I started reading all the addresses in order. Never sounded flustered. He let me go a couple minutes. 

Then he disconnected. 

I won bitch.~~Karen Customer: Im calling because I have a charge on my account and I dont know what it was for.

Me: Id love to assist you with that. Can you please provide me with some more details? Why dont we start with the date and the amount of the charge?

Karen Customer: Im driving, hold onhas a low-volume conversation with an occupant in the car, but loud enough so I can hear her sigh and say, Can you believe they need me to give them this information? 

Me: Tempted to offer Karen Customer our spiffy state of the art service called process of elimination, where I go through the 400 transactions she conducted in the last eight weeks, and she can pick out the one that sounds unfamiliar~~And the Lord spake, saying ... Then shalt thou count to 3G, no more, no less. 3G shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be 3G. 4G shalt thou not count, neither count thou 2G, excepting that thou then proceed to 3G. 5G is right out.~~I've had the same with asking customers to check if their cable was plugged into their router. I've learned to phrase the question differently due to reddit mainly, (thanks to all these posts!), Instead of asking a customer to check if their cable was plugged in, i would ask them to unplug it so i could do a line test or some other made up reason. And the surprise is that 70% of the time this worked. The other 30% were of course the ones that called in while not being anywhere near their router.

&amp;#x200B;

This pretty much eliminate the possibility of them just answering "" yes "" to my questions by actively involving them in the troubleshooting, even though i had to tell little white lies to get them to do so by making up bullshit reasons.~~We have a policy that if a customer is driving, we are allowed to cut off the call. Because its unsafe for the driver to be on the road while talking to the phone, especially if the call has the potential to escalate into the customer's emotion affecting their driving and may cause an accident. Even if the customer is on headset.~~I have a strict ""we can't do it for you "" policy with my team. If a customer calls in and asks us to do something on their account (like change their plan) and they can do it themselves, we tell them we can't help them until they've tried it themselves first. If they put up a stink we tell them it's policy and it's a security thing (even though it's technically not).

I think a lot of companies double down on the ""customer is always right"" approach way too much to their and their customers detriment.

Setting proper expectations with customers upfront and making it easy and accessible to self serve does wonders for reducing call volumes.~~",The commenter explains that call center staff are often the first point of contact for customers who have issues with their company's website or account.

The 735mbps will just haaaaaave to do for now.~~Gen X here...I remember my kid scoffing at me a few years ago because I don't know/use shortcuts. I told him I'm self-taught and he was the one who was constantly asking me to fix his computer when he was a child and would download viruses/dodgy stuff. That shut him up lol. Google is an amazing thing.~~Many moons ago, and for about 15 years, I was a computer programmer.  This was a little bit after punch cards but just as PCs started to take off (my first job we only had DOS)...

...anyway, just establishing the general time...

...most of my coworkers where male.  But the few females who where there were mostly VERY good.  As time went on, more and more women entered the job and female programmers became common. And, again, they were almost all very good at their job.

Since this was 20-30 years ago, I really don't understand people who STILL have an issue with female techs/programmers/much anything.~~This happened to me before actually. In fact just yesterday I had someone argue with me that they were moving and all they should have to do is plug in their modem. He kept repeating ""I'm just trying to find out what to do!"" I kept answering with ""we have to send out a tech to do utility work, but we can schedule that with you""

He started yelling and I don't play around on the phone, I stopped talking after he yelled HELLLOOOOOOOOO and he ended the call. 

Im not even going to tell him it's shut off from the pole, we've had people climb them and get stuck. ~~I am a boomer and I also got tired of teaching people how to use the internet as a IT professional. People who supposedly grew up with computers and the internet that do not know how to use it or any applications.  My wife had to teach young teachers how to find files, save files and how to do basic word applications.  How do these people even make graduation?

I am a bit more tolerant of boomers because they did not grow up with it but come on....30 year olds? WTF?  My mother passed 8 years ago at 92 and she knew more than many people in the office.

Glad I retired 4 years ago now. I do not tell ANYONE I know IT because then they all want free help.~~Sigh. 
This is an example of why Im nice to tech support people.  I actually became WoW friends with one who helped me once.  The only time I was ever mean to one - he continually asked me if Id tried plugging my laptop in when I was calling about the charging port being broken -_-.  This was after introducing myself and explaining I knew tech decently, what had happened, and I needed to get it fixed under warranty.
(It was assumed because I was female that I knew nothing).  That time the guy got an earful and then told I needed to speak to another rep. ~~I once worked with someone who told us never to get Wireless internet because they had to put it in one window so they could get a good signal from the satellite. They lived in a pretty good sized city and for some reason her boyfriend got them satellite internet, not your normal wifi. ~~When I worked for a phone company, explaining pre-paid and post-paid services (in conjunction with past due bills) used to give me nightmares. I was ""Yes, you paid it once but in order to continue service, you're going to have to pay it again and again.""

Still gives me the chills.~~My sister moved her stuff back to college after a holiday, got back to her room, unpacked her stuff, and her monitor wouldn't turn on.

She used to heavily overspend and be living on a knife edge for a lot of her terms, so she couldn't afford the cost of a new monitor, and that's the mood she was in when she called me.

She's actually reasonably competent, tech-wise, so she'd gone through a few things before she called me, and nothing had worked.

After listening to her freak out for about ten minutes, I eventually managed to calm her down enough that I felt like I could ask her to check whether the plug was pushed all the way into the wall socket...~~I work in web support for a credit card company and it blows my mind how many people just do not understand how the internet or their own devices work.

Ended up on unemployment during COVID because I had a panic attack due to stress. Got that extra government money in addition to state unemployment  Seriously, if you dont have basic comprehension skills, you dont need anything internet related. I will say that this was largely an American problem. I was on the EU team for a bit, and the elderly over there were self sufficient enough to learn the basics and even tell me facts about their devices before I could tell them. Too many Americans have been coddled and have developed the entitlement mentality. To quote Tony Soprano: Youre entitled to shit!~~My first call was working for Gateway tech support back in 99... Had this little old lady on the line who was setting up her brand new computer.  We got everything set up, and I was telling her to use her mouse to click the start button.  What's a mouse?  As I try to explain, she says OH, you mean my foot pedal?  She had plugged it in and put it on the floor like a sewing machine pedal.  . Love old people, so adorable.  ~~&gt; (hello, we're a fucking call centre, did you ever consider maybe it's your phone?)

I had a caller like this once. An old man said he called in and talked to three different agents and couldn't hear any of us so he deduced that there was a problem with our phone system. No old timer, if you tried three different people including myself then the problem is almost certainly on your end. ~~My friend is a tech savvy guy. He's even just landed a job in IT.

Yet he still can't seem to separate WiFi and internet. My internet will be down and he'll say ""But I have a full WiFi signal!"" It baffles me that he can't get his head around it.~~I got this call a lot when I worked for a mobile carrier. Both android and iPhone have places in settings where you can see what is being used. Just showing that to the user defused most of these calls and they had to accept it, but there were some that either refused to look, claimed there wasn't much usage there, or conveniently just reset their phone. There have only been a couple of known issues that caused data usage, there were specific verifiable symptoms, and 99.9% of complainers did not fall into this category.

I especially love it when they say they don't use any data on their smartphone, but they use imessage and email and Google and candy crush....candy crush uses a shit ton of data. If you are on an android *I can see what apps you have on your phone you idiot* I know you have Netflix. Ugh. ~~I've worked in call centers for both tech support and customer support. Tech support people don't have the same way of being scored as customer support people do. The call center I worked for in tech support even didn't want me to say sorry about the situation because that was ""admitting we did something wrong."" I agree that this conversation would have been very frustrating, but it's not fair to hold every call center person to the same standards that you are held to, because each the management at different call centers have different requirements.

It doesn't read like the first person ignored your issues either, as they did go through the steps they would need to before offering you a tech. ~~I have at least one customer complain because she had to plug in her modem after being told it was wireless.

Her complaint was because we lied to her......she still needs to plug the modem in though and at no point did we state that the modem does not need power.

~~Can relate.  A few of my female co-workers at the call center I work -- which does tech support for a major WA software company -- would actually get sexist male customers like these. They won't actually ask for a man but instead ask for a manager and if that manager happens to be a man they would listen to what he had to say even if it was the same thing my female co-worker told the male customer.  However, if it was a female manager they would then ask for someone higher than her until they get a guy.  SMH.~~Oh no that is what I love about here. This is cut and dry NOT a manager issue you will deal with me and this is policy. You can cry manager till you are blue in the face but you wanting something for free isn't a reason. Do they pay commercial rates? No. well that your residential status is the same as little johnny down the street who watches disney+. And ours and other ISPs have what is called an MSA and if they a business it says we are not paying any losses imagined or otherwise while the service isn't working to what the customer thinks it should. I enjoy calls like this. The racist one. Wait sir what color are our voices again?~~I have received a letter and I don't understand it.

Ok can you let me know the date of the letter?

I threw it away.

ok well there are twenty four letters on this system I don't know to which you are referring.

Can you explain all of them to me?

...............~~Omg yes. There were times that they were so computer illiterate I was shocked how they were even able to call our number.


We always tried our best to remote into our customers computers to fix something for ourselves. Once I asked a man to go to a website and he didn't know how. So I literally just said ""okay, open the internet"" and this man had no idea how to. I was shocked.~~If you're on a windows machine, check out the 'pathping' command. Use it to ping the address of your server and it will output packet loss along the way to the connection.

The first thing I always suggested was change out the Ethernet cable if one connects from your work computer to the modem 

Second would be run a speed test on your work computer and make note of the results then present it to your supervisors. They may need to open a ticket for further investigation.

Wish I could remember more but Ive been out of that line of work for a year now so I cant recall what other steps I would have them take~~Related anecdote: A few years ago my parents were at a reunion event.

Can you confirm that this is an accurate description of your situation, sir?""

And he did it while he was on the line with you! How did he not think that would get noticed?!~~In my former call center, we had a language service with access to interpreters for most spoken languages, which was nice.

In my current job, we don't, because it's much less focused on phones.  My Vietnamese friend got summoned over to a colleague's desk one day because we ran into a non-english-speaking caller.  My friend's Vietnamese is pretty good but not perfect, and the call started getting technical.  So then my friend called up his dad in Vietnam as a second translator.  So he was bouncing back from the main call to the cell phone and would get a quick translation for a technical phrase, like ""statutory maximum fee"" or some such, and bounce back again.~~As someone who also works from home... that is a good fucking idea. I really should go that route, especially since it'll be the same fucking price I'm paying right now for the same shitty fucking service.

edit: aaaaaaaaaaand of course no one else is available in my area except fucking comcast and att.~~Another thing, too...Occasionally I get old ladies who either hesitantly let me walk them thru things OR just staight out say ""OMG im so relieved to get a WOMAN!!!""

The ones who say they are relieved to get a woman tend to also tell me that they believe that I am more likely to be patient with them and walk them through things slowly. They also tend to believe that women pay more attention to detail. 

The ones who are hesitant to start with often seem shocked when the things I tell them end up actually working. lol. 

Occasionally one will make a comment after the fact like ""Back in my day, they didn't let women do jobs like this"" 

Some say it in a way that sounds envious, some say it in a surprised way. 

I usually respond with something along the lines of ""Women can do.....Things.""~~The first call center I worked in did t have any management after 7:00pm and we were open till 10:00pm.  So if we had a supervisor call we would just hand the headset to whoever wasnt on a call.

No not at the moment, cant you just remove them?

I dont know
Usually by then they are usually shitty and demanding I just fix it or get them all checked looking for possible frauds.

Open the call - City and listing, please.

At every ten seconds of dead air time - One moment, please.

On finding the correct number - Hold for the number, please.

If no one was on the line when we got connected - after ten seconds, repeat, City and listing, please. After ten more seconds, Operator leaving the line. And we would disconnect and go to the next call.

I have worked in 15+ call centers since then, and that was the most mind-numbing job Ive ever had.~~I get a few of these every day. You get used to it. I used to get mad when they would, but I learned to not let their anger affect me. Not only does it improve call control but it REALLY pisses the customer off when you don't react to their childishness, and that feels great. I've got this sticker on my screen that says 'emotional intelligence' and I look at it whenever I feel myself getting pissed off. ~~The 'can only issue a credit for this once' is mostly bluster. They're getting away with it because they're banking on the idea that a nuisance suit is more of a nuisance to you than them. However, charging you for service they didn't provide is one variety of theft or another (depending on your jurisdiction and applicable laws) and they can get sued for it as many times as you'd like.

Not that you necessarily want to go through a court case, but a good lawyer can probably get them to settle the amount pretty quickly. It may be worth talking to one who does free initial consultations to get an idea of what kind of case you have, if they hassle you on a prompt reimbursement.~~I had a customer yell at me for 20 minutes saying I was lying that we weren't So and So Cell Phone company.

Basically she had ordered those stick on the wall hooks and they fell off. The packaging says they should have stayed on but there was *no guarantee*. Because the order was only $10 or something I offered her a replacement or refund to keep her happy, she didn't seem to know exactly what she wanted so I again said look, what is it you want me to do for you? She started having a tantrum and demanded I transfer her to a MAN in our furniture assembly department, because I clearly didn't know what I was talking about. Um. What. Plastic sticky hooks are not furniture. They're also not rocket science.~~Either way, this guy would be pissed since he was calling from his car so which cell phone won't turn on? And when he pulls the battery, the line will disconnect so he will need to call back in and then get one of the other hundred plus call takers.~~Honestly. Ill get relatives and friends of the customer calling as if we can fix the entire issue without them even being near the device. Theyll act like theyre with it and as soon as I mention unplugging something, then they want to say theyre not home right now. Why are you even calling then?~~Ugh. Definitely. When I was a frontline agent I used to think all the tier 2 agents in our center were jerks for constantly complaining about transfers from other frontline agents. Ever since joining tier 2 support though I completely understand it. Pretty much none of the calls transferred to me should have been transferred. Extremely frustrating. ~~They think that they are ""annoying"" or ""aggravating"" the company by wasting their own time and building up unnecessary hostility and frustration. I like to beat them to the punch:

""I see that you have called several times in the past month, we have offered a resolution to which you decline, can you tell me in what way I can assist? So you dont have to tell your story to a brand new person each time you call?""

~~I deal with these kinds of people all the time at the ISP I work for. We provide the modem and the connection, that's it. If you choose to add your own VPN, server, DMZ, router, node or whatever else, it's on you. That's why ISP stands for Internet Service Provider emphasis on **provider**. We give you the service. We didn't give you the VPN, we didn't give you the pirating website you're trying to access, it's on you.

I'm sure if they knew the problem they would have been able to tell you, they don't usually withhold useful information on purpose. I suppose she could have been a bit more polite about it.~~Ugh. I work for a consumer electronics call center and get these all the time when people want to buy laptops/computers. ""I'm looking for someone who can help with me with finding a good gaming laptop""

Perhaps you should have offered them double the money for their lost value. If it is worth 15 cents a day, to show how regretful you all are, give her a 30 cents credit and she should be happy, right?

Your company is only responsible for your product, not for her level of trauma for when it is temporarily unavailable. Maybe next time you can offer her an appointment with a technician if she still has a cast that makes troubleshooting difficult.~~Wait...I just realized that sometimes my phone is on my moms 5ghz WiFi, but will alternate to the 2ghz and/or vice versa (dont recall which). 

Can you explain this and the difference and which one my shit should on like Im 5? You or anyone here who knows wtf it all means. Thank you in advance. 

Also, its mighty hilarious watching people post from their 4G LTE phones about how Bill Gates made 5G to carry the corona virus to the whole world, and theyll be damned if theyre gonna be forced to wear masks for Bill Gates! Im sorry, but you basically crazy cat lady yelled that the virus is dangerous enough to wear masks...but only as long as its not Bill Gates behind it all? What the hell? 

Anyway.~~It's always fun being the technically apt person calling for support, too.  


""I don't have Internet access for some reason.  Channels are bonded on my modem, I have a valid IP lease, and I'm able to ping your head end, but I can't reach any DNS servers.""  


""Sorry to hear that sir, let me see if I can help you resolve this issue today, are you able to restart your modem?""

\*headdesk\*~~Other thing to try; do a speedtest at moments you have issues and one in the dead-middle of the night.
Even if you arent being throttled, it could be that your ISP has more connections set up in your area and the neigbours are using their connection too.
This can create a network congestion on the area-hub where your connection goes through.~~Hey, it sounds like we work for the same company!

I'm with the tech support team, sorry you has to get her :/  This is a pretty common request/demand from customers though.  Most are pretty friendly about it though, once you explain it.

But some people... yeah no.  Only thing that will make them understand is to do exactly what they are saying and let them figure it out on their own.~~Hey, had a guy call me 3 times telling me that he hopes I'll be raped and that he would love to tell me how he would rape me just because he had a $10 late fee cause he didn't pay on time.

So you know, CCs completely ruined my hope in humanity too.

I'm sorry you had to go through 30 mins of interacting with that misguided dimwit. ~~When I was working tech support and would get assholes like that, I would find the female sup with the sweetest most innocent voice and put them on the line, let her at them. It was always fun to listen in. It was great at this time we only had female sups.~~Not a call center but when I worked for a home improvement store that rhymes with clothes. I had someone that had a question on plumbing, so I got the specialist. She came over and the guy lost it. He wanted a man. She said she has 20 years in the industry. Didn't want to hear it. So I asked what he was trying to do. With her right next to me, I asked her and repeated what she said. He still got pissed off and left. Kinda made me die inside because she really knows her stuff, more than some men.~~OMG I can relate. I'm the CTO at a small company in the midwest.  It gets pretty old having to explain more than once that

1. Yes I am the Chief Technical Officer, not their assistant 
2. Yes I am the decision maker, not that random guy in the hall you are looking at for an explanation
3. Where the door is so they can take off to where they came from~~The DL here simply had no clue that 'MY INTERNET AND CABLE' didn't include a WiFi router. She obviously had no clue as to what was needed beyond getting the cable into her home and the modem connected to that.

To her defense, I'm betting the installer didn't at all tell her about a router she needed that had WiFi capability.

To the installers' defense, had he told her this, she probably would have yelled at him.

Bottom line is: DL is clueless and probably a racist and bigot on top it, long with entitled.~~Dont get me wrong. I agree customer should be at or near the equipment. But sometimes being at the equipment is no help. 

Had phone line go down so I called tech support. Went through trouble shooting to no avail. Rep opened ticket so someone would come out for on site visit. 

Turns out there was a system outage in my area. 

One would think that checking the system status first thing would be part of the troubleshooting.~~My internet is not working.

Can we check which lights are on, on your modem?

I cant, Im driving.

Customer thinks theyre a genius multitasker.

To be fair, *sometimes* theres an ongoing issue, and you know its beyond the basics.

I have a bonded DSL connection, and it gets pretty flaky sometimes. Unfortunately, I have to get the right person on the phone - usually someone above tier 1, or at least someone in the same country as they get a higher level of training. 

Or I reach out to my local (small town) lines person/tech; they know who to contact.~~My response is ""cool, thank you for calling. Looking forward to your call back at your own convenience""

If I dont hang up then, they will, in the minority  tell me I'm not willing to help them and that I'm not allowed to hang up on them.

Silence is golden when faced with a statement.

Control the conversation with clear questions.  Open questions should help but sometimes closed question a is all you've got.

Especially when they dont have their order or customer details.

Call centre based customer service has been around for 30 years.

In ending fuck off and die alone all those that call while driving.~~One job tax time app/software the 1st call I got was someone saying their ss# had been used fraudulently I had to get basic info and transfer the call to a higher tier agent and it was difficult the caller was difficult but I made it thru and honestly never had much issues after. Had a few weird calls but nothing quite so ugh~~I had a client who could never grasp the distinction between username and password. Then he could somehow never find the 15 different papers with his written passwords.

He of course refused to use anything organized, like for instance a little black book. (Address books work really well for this).

No chance of using a password manager - couldnt be arsed to learn, and quite probably not able to.

I finally added a second recovery email (one of mine) to his MS account so I could just reset it remotely.

Pretty sure he was getting phished weekly, or handing it out to various would-be girlfriends, as I was getting unknown login warning emails every day or so.

Ended up blowing him off after one too many attempts at a lower bill after an oh-my-god-emergency callout for which I didnt even charge him emergency rates.~~Once, I got a customer who had only a tv and a cellphone to perform the internet set up, I violated protocol and ended up doing the set up myself because the man couldn't do it with that, he needed a pc or a tablet at the very least.

I made him write down his email, the password, the steps I took and then had him read them back to me, longest call ever (four hours, if I recall correctly).

I asked to leave early that day.~~I would like to find out who's idea it was to have average call time as a good measure for customer service.

Then kick them in the groin, the head and then the groin again.

I would then ban them from all caffeen, alcohol, tobacco or any other drug, and put them on as a level 1 call-centre jockey for six months.

Then kick them again.~~&gt;I'll cancel my subscriptions if you don't send a tech immediately

Ok, thank you for being our customer. Your access to our service has been terminated at your request. Our cancellation department is determining your final bill. Please return our equipment to (address) by (date) or we will send a bill for replacement pieces.  Have a wonderful day!~~In my call center assholes like this get deliberately escalated up the line to all female supervisors. Luckily, we have enough of them to go around. Plus both my ops manager and call center director are female. I'm in a similar line of tech support as OP and it does happen occasionally.~~Everytime a customer threatens to take legal action:

Customer: I'm going to sue you!

HenriquesDumbCousin: You're on your right, have a good day.

*click*

**OR**

Customer: I'm going to sue you!

HenriquesDumbCousin: I do not answer to threats, have a good day.

*click*

It really depends on their tone of voice.~~Yup, I attempted to help my FIL once with a computer issue, never again.  He doesnt even want to try to understand.  My MIL, on the other hand, only calls me when shes tried to fix it herself and cant.  They are divorced, he has an advanced degree, she did not go to college.~~ahh yes the infamous 'well you're my internet company, fix it' saying.

always love these customers.  usually i can talk to them well enough to get them to kinda understand the issue to the point that they can realize that it's on their end.  especially when it comes to how the router works on their end.

the only one this doesn't work for tho is speed issues...  that's just a cringeworthy issue.~~Yep OP, common scenario. You can take it as a compliment though, often people think the problem is with your gear because they WANT the problem to be with your gear - because you're delivering good service and they don't want to go anywhere else, where they think they'll be dismissd or have their issue go unresolved.

I always found it helpful to have a very basic analogy ready to go, for such situations, like:

""Sir, let's pretend you have a record player. It plays a Beatles record with no problem. It plays a Led Zepplin record no problems. It plays a Pink Floyd Record no problems. But it skips on the Fleetwood Mac record... where do you think the problem is, with the record or the player that works fine on every other record?

- your modem is the record player, your TV is the broken record. I can't help you with your TV, you need to speak to Samsung.""
~~",The commenter doesn't understand why people prefer a male in tech and believes that a woman can be as good or better than a man. They suggest that the company should offer a credit for the lost value of the product and that the customer service representative should have been more understanding of the customer'
11.0,"&gt;why my phone is fine

Becouse I fucking asked for it you twatwaffle. Don't you think I know that? Maybe you should shut the fuck up and do what you are told, after all you did call me for help! otherwise shut the fuck up while I transfer your bitch ass to our cancellations team. 

*if only calls weren't recorded ~~I used to work for a credit card processor. We provided service for credit card machines, mostly used by small businesses. I'd frequently have similar conversations with people. They couldn't take credit cards while their machine was down, but never had any interest in buying a backup so they wouldn't have to wait for us to overnight one.~~It's almost better when they're overt about it. I worked in a small department (4 employees, half men/half women) doing tech support for a bank's online services. I was shocked at the gall of grumpy old men who'd demand to talk to a man because they were sure me, a woman, couldn't handle their request. Despite the fact that I trained both of my male coworkers.~~I had the exact same thing happen!  Several calls to ISP and no resolution.  Finally insisted they come out.  He changed a couple coaxial plugs that were old and disconnected some cables that were going to rooms that didnt need them.  That was about a week ago and it hasnt cut out since!~~My mom understands most of her phone and computer stuff. Not necessarily the intricacies, but enough that she only comes to us with like actual problems. And her boyfriend has a flip phone and doesn't want to really get into technology, he knows what he wants and it's not that. Mostly it sucks for him though because so many things in life now require technology, so when he comes across something he has to do on the computer, it can be really frustrating for him. Usually he calls up me or my brother, but both him and my mom.are real respectful, and would never get angry at someone helping them because they know they're uneducated in the topic.~~Dear Boomers, STOP clicking ""YES"" to everything you see pop up and saving everything to your browsers (autofill) if you dont know how use it! We run tech support for a web based virtual POS system for small business owners. I cant tell you how many times these business owners have ""charged the wrong card"" because the card number they type in is overriding to the 500 other saved customer cards on their browser. So scary~~",The commenter suggests that the person who called for help should shut up and do what is asked of them. They also share their experience of working in a small department where male coworkers would demand to speak to a woman because they were sure she couldn't handle their request. The commenter also notes that
12.0,"Report it to your supervisor.  Say you suspect she was wasting your time on purpose and you suspect she never intended to complete the reservation.  I have worked in the contact center industry for 30 years.  This is a common tactic for a certin type of crazy person who has  some perceived gripe with the company.  They call over and over again and just waste agent's time.  One investigation I took part in showed the company had received over 2000 calls in 2 years from the same nutcase.  Wasted hundreds of hours of agent time and never bought a ticket.  We would block his phone number and he would buy another burner phone and start again the next week. ~~Putting aside the crazy user for a bit: If the ID needs to be complicated to protect your account, your security setup went wrong somewhere in the first place. Unguessable usernames boil down to ""security by obscurity"" and is really not a principle I want to see in action at my bank.

I want my ID to, well, ID my account, and my password/2FA to prove I am the account holder. For that, my ID could be 12345 for all I care.

But banking and IT security is laughable often enough anyway. My former bank mandated online logins as 12-character alpha lowercase username and 5 character alphanumerical lowercase password. You'd need more to make a transaction, but that id/password would give you access to the whole transaction history of the account.  The online school time tables of our interns have stronger security.~~Never know where these people get their numbers from. One guy tried claiming 99% of all PCs purchased in 2018 have Wifi, and when I told him if that is true he got the 1% that doesn't. He ended up with a lower number because he tried looking up the date and it dropped from 99% to 70%~~this drives me crazy!! they get all angry about how much information we need from them, but theyre the ones that offered it all up. i work in a pharmacy, so i just need their name and date of birth. i get calls all the time where patients just throw out their address and phone number when i start to ask them to verify their dob. like, let me speak for a second and we wont have issues~~I accidentally hit kicked my power strip today during my last call. Had a guy on the phone who was talking out of his ass about nothing related to my job. I thought to myself I can let this ride for 15 minutes (it was 4:15 I was done at 4:30) welllpp 4:40 rolled around and I couldnt do it anymore. ~~I had a guy call up for a retailer (I work for their store card/finance side) he had an item in his online basket/cart and called up to pay for it over the phone... I told him it doesnt work like that but Id guide him through (not even our job, I could have given him the retail depts number cos his request isnt in my job description but he made me laugh so I offered) he kicked off like Oh well why not!? I want this item! I dont do online! ~~I get this a lot when I tell people I will waive the fee we normally charge for taking payments with a live rep.

CALLER: I want to make this payment but don't want to be charged for it.

ME: No problem, I'll waive that fee.

CALLER: Because I just don't think it's fair, I don't want to be charged for it.

ME: It's okay, I've waived that fee and will take your payment for free.

CALLER: Can you take my payment but waive the fee?

ME: I've already waived the fee and can take your payment-

CALLER: Because I really don't want to pay that fee.

ME: *headdesk*

So. Much. Repeating myself, like your call.~~&gt;sorry ma'am unfortunately I'll need to terminate your policy as you've chosen a policy which requires the use of a smart phone app which you've openly admitted and demonstrated you have no idea how to use. Please take some classes on basic usage of your device and then we will consider allowing you to take out this policy again - we can help you use the app but are not responsible for teaching you the basics of using your device. That's a level of knowledge we expect you to have before taking out such a policy.~~People telling me they couldn't see an option or menu item on the screen when you know it's there because EVERYONE has it is something that never failed to enrage me when it went on for several minutes. I always had the theory that it was because people thought they were having to call you for technical help it meant what you were asking them to do was more complex than it actually was and people's brain just didn't get out of that ""oh no I'm not tech savvy and can't possibly learn anything new"" mode.

&amp;#x200B;

Later I just came to realise that some people are just dumb as dirt.~~At a time like that, if someone was actually possibly about to gain access to her account, is the exact time for security.

The first red flag is hurry hurry hurry, this is an emergency, get me in now!  

Communicating that there is a problem and urgent need should get the agent on the phone to speed thought the process, but not skip steps.~~I was talking a lady through our website-she was lovely, and we aren't really monitored on AHT so I was more than happy. We have a specific page on basic IT skills I was trying to get to, but she kept on saying she could just see a grey box,and the page wasn't changing. It took me a good few minutes to realise she didn't know the difference between left and right clicking.~~I have been given the title of family IT guy.

My brother in law is particularly bad. Hes older and just gets mad at the computer when he fucks something up. 

I heard he got a call from Microsoft and they upgraded his firewall. His PC is faster now. 

I just told him dont do any banking or type in passwords on that computer. Hes not going to listen anyway. ~~Omg yes, I couldn't agree more! I work for a US based call center for an insurance/financial company and 90% of the callers that come into the internet queue are older and don't even understand how to type in ""companyname.com"" and if I ask them what browser they're using they laugh in confusion. I admire them *trying* to learn but I dont think its wise to try to complete financial transactions online if they don't know what theyre doing to even login....the oldest one I've assisted was 100 years old, seriously.~~Worked in banking. The number of 30+ minute calls (target of 4 minutes per call) with 80 year olds wanting to register for online banking was mind blowing. Sometimes they'd realized that if it was this difficult for them to register than it would be hard and possibly a security risk for them to use it. And for every half dozen 80 year olds that struggled with it, there'd always be one mid 90's person who could do it with no problems~~This is definitely one thing I wish married couples understood. It doesn't matter if you've been married 5 days or 50 years. If you're not the listed owner I cannot give you access to the account!!! I currently work retentions for a web hosting company so it's not so much of a big deal now, but I definitely got that a lot at my previous job which was for a bank. It was absolutely amazing how many recently separated/divorced significant others attempted to call in thinking they were going to gain access to the other's account. They don't want to hear that we have these measures in place for their security, but they'd lose their shit if all of their money disappeared. People are so ridiculous. ~~I don't understand how people can pay so little attention to what they're doing when they always complain about how long they have to wait.

If you're so fucking busy, you'd think you would be paying extra attention to make sure everything gets done correctly and efficiently the first time.~~I feel your pain intensely.  Remote computer support is its own hell

Her: Yes...what do I doooooooo??

Me: Is your login name there?

Her: I see my name.

Me: Ok. Put in your password.

Her: Which one? 

Me: The...one you log in to your computer with?

Her: Yeah, but which one? Can you tell me what it is?

\[15mins of this and I'm ready to start drinking again\]~~Last year I got this call:

Nice old lady: My computer is very slow right now

Me: How many windows you got open? Please close all your windows.

Background: bam, bam, bam, bam,  (????????)

Nice old lady: I closed all the windows but the computer is still slow.

**I am still on the same call...   ;-)**~~No, not cookies.

More likely he's trying to logon from his work account and their IT have banned your bank site at their firewall - hence the contact your administrator message.

If it was a dns issue would be a different error - i.e. site not found.

My 2 cents!~~I've worked in IT for 14 years now.  Its entirely plausible that he after 40 years doesn't know what he's doing.  I've come across many IT workers in my time who are almost gifted in what they do, usually supporting some proprietary software, but have zero skills in general IT.
 
I've even known some Cisco CCIEs who lack a lot of basic Microsoft type skills simply because they only deal with Linux all day.~~I run into these people more times then I like to admit. It always seems to me that theyre mostly old boomers that are a proud of not knowing technology. Not sure what the mindset is about that is, but acting ignorant in other similar situations I dont think they would act the same way. Sometimes, I just feel hopeless trying to help because they either dont understand or dont want to understand and want you to hold their hand like theyre 6 years old.~~Wow what a dumb fucker! Without giving yourself away, was this for a game or other entertainment account? Or something *important* like billing or financial? Shoot, my son could download and install those Nick.com games when he was like 4 years old--very smart. But no WAY would I let him set up one of MY accounts for something important! ~~I monitored a call one time, customer had bought a laptop with a 90 day warranty.  Called 180 days in wanting support.  Tech declined.  Customer then requested a refund.  Technician passed it to CSR.  CSR said hell no.  Customer escalated to CS Manager.  CS Manager is a 6'6"" gentleman that makes Wesley Snipes look pale.  Customer gets on a rant, starts yelling 'it's because i'm black, isn't it?'  I look across the call center to see CSM get a big smile on his face.  'Lady, I'm dark as night.  Don't even pull that shit.'.  

I deleted that recording and gave everybody 5's across the board.~~The whole technology thing just seems to have gotten worse for a large segment of society.  They just expect things to work with no effort.

Edit: details, speculation~~When I worked in a call centre I would always ensure I had a call back number, then if I could tell it was going to be a call such as this I would disconnect and call back. 

Our metrics for calls only counted for customers inbound and not outbound when I called the customers back. 

Customers loved the extra attention and support, my bosses loved my handle time, and I got to just chill while dealing with old people and their piss easy issues. A classic win win~~I don't mind helping people who have online problems, but if you've saved yourself 40 a year by signing up to manage your account online then that's what you're obliged to do.

There's always a long pause after I finish while they process the fact that, no, they're talking to a real person and actually have to say words now.

~~It's funny. Part of the appeal of apple devices is the apparent lack of malware that effects them. Well the reason there is a lack of serious malware for apple devices is because they make up so little of the overall market of devices that it's inefficient time and energy wise for bad actors to try and attack apple devices unless they have a very specific target in mind. If this guy was right, Apple devices would be significantly more affected more often by malware.

Now, it is accurate that in the United States, Apple holds roughly 50% of market share in the cellphone market. So it's fair to say that roughly half of all active cellphones(have an active phone number associated with them)in the US are Iphones but when we look at all devices not just cellphones and we expand our search worldwide that number shrinks significantly.

If they have to be because of the nature of the system, then so be it, but if just one phone call like this gets stopped in the future, a few lines of code could have saved this tech illiterate customer some grief. ~~I hate password issues, especially as I work an out of hours shift with anything from none to very limited systems acesss.

When people call and say ""it won't let me login....."" I have a hard time trying to keep my shit together - lately the silence after is really starting to bug me and I just want to scream at them:

&gt;YES... AND? The error message is WHAT exactly? Also, what are you trying to login to, have you every accessed it before, have you tried the forgotten password link on the page?""

I need information bitch I'm not sure what you're expecting otherwise?

&gt; it won't login!

&gt;**thanks for letting us know, but you're obviously stupid and doing something wrong so please keep trying goodbye.**~~""I'm sorry, our chat session was disconnected somehow. I have gone ahead and changed your username to 7wiNKl3! 

You will also need to reset your password on first login. Password requirements are 16 characters minimum, at least one capital letter, at least one lower case letter, at least one digit, and at least one special character. No spaces allowed.~~Not a day goes by without one of these calls. Lately is just old people forgetting their passwords and not able to reset it for one reason or another. I really try with them since I'd rather spend an hour trying to assist a kind old lady than deal with a rude idiot who has no respect for customer service~~Yep. Absolutely right. 

Our default password is Pa55word but I have to spell it out because they are too stupid to understand Password with a capital P and replace the ss with 5s. 

So thats Password5?

No!

I just dont even tell them. I just spell it. 

Capital P as in Papa, lowercase a as in alpha, 5, 5 again...

I cant even say 5, 5. I have to specify there are two 5s if they think I am repeating. 

Oh my Lord!! ~~","The commenter, who works in retail tech support, suspects that a Chrome update may be to blame for the issue. They also mention that when they used to work in a call center, they would always ensure they had a call back number, even if they didn't have access to it."
12.0,"I get it. I deal with it too. Drives me batty but... It's not just old people, it's bad UX. They've been told rules (has to have capitals, numbers, special characters) and then those rules are different for different places. Complex is king so they try nonsense instead of something they can remember. Then the ability to reset without calling is bizarre (banks requiring 3+ factor authentication or an art software company not allowing any letter from your name even though that's not how it is explained in their requirements) which leads to more confusion. They get flustered and frustrated that something doesn't just work so when they do finally call they're struggling to listen and comprehend because they're trying to find the right box and hear the right thing... Dammit, I'm old. The trend to passphrases is going to suck. :(~~Asking a million questions, repeating herself, and changing her mind repeatedly? OP literally could have had my mother on the line. It wasn't, but it could've been. Mom must have all the information before she can make a decision, and it makes the rest of the family crazy sometimes.

She wonders why CSRs seem to hate working with *her*, but *I* get what I want 99% of the time without either party even raising their voice. Meanwhile I feel sorry for CSRs who have to put up with her bullshit

u/Ceyepher I salute your patience. It's more than I could manage in that situation.~~and this is exactly why i lucked out in getting out of tech support before mobile devices were even able to access websites. i had enough  problems dealing with pc users who barley knew what a mouse was (at the time). iphones were not even around then, and all people used Google for was to search their own name. i work for a cable/internet provider and just explaining the difference between modems and routers makes me have migraines.

i commend anyone in tech support for what they have to deal with now versus when i dealt with it. my only real question to the customers at the time was which version of windows are you running...95/98 or 3.1 for real old school guys.~~Hello fellow fruity person!

Thank you for giving me a glimpse of what to expect when I transition from the mobile side to the desktop/laptop side this summer!

And, yes, I feel your pain as Ive had plenty of these kind of users on the mobile side to work with.~~They often go off at me because where the hell do you people get such personal information about me (cats name, first car, whatever) and simply wont believe they both selected the questions and gave the answers when they set up their online banking. But no, they never did that (even though the answers are correct) we made intrusive investigations and did it ourselves, apparently~~I deal with this every single day. I ask for the address and the give me the password. Or I will ask them a direct question in an effort to troubleshoot and they will ramble on and about something completely irrelevant and end up not even answering the original question. I have come to the conclusion that people by and large dont listen to what others say and that they are just waiting for their turn to talk.~~There absolutely are some people who think that EVERYBODY has iPhones, or at least everyone who isn't absolutely poor and completely beneath them.

I have an android phone, so does my wife, so does my teenage son.  

Amazingly enough, every now and then, I get people who look at me funny when they realize I don't have an iPhone and have an Android, like somehow I'm poor or lesser or disappointing.

Whatever.  It's a phone.~~I spoke to a child and used our usual spiel of 'the security word can be anything you want, like a favourite band or favourite snack' she decided to go down the snack route and that the password should be 'cheesy balls', after some very immature sniggering from her mum and myself, we suggested a band might be a better option.~~Helpful advice:

Reddit formatting is touchy and requires a double space before hitting ""enter"" to achieve the formatting you attempted. An easy work around is hitting ""enter"" twice instead.

Me: standard greeting (add 2 spaces here)

C: I'm locked out of my online account, the password needs reset.

Me: Ok, can you verify blah blah blah.

C: verifies

Me: Ok, your temporary password is Welcome123 percent, go ahead and try it.

C: What's a percent sign?

Me: (really?) It looks like two circles with a line between it.

C: I can't find it, where is it?

Me: (facepalm and looks at keyboard) It's above the number 4 on your keyboard.

C: Oh!~~I volunteer at an information desk at a hospital.

I mean I know I'm monotone but lady pls. ~~My Dad often rings me with computer related problems.  I have lived this with him.  He cannot see icons that I know are there.  I spent ages talking him through finding the button for Amazon wish lists.  I was yelling down the phone ""It's the fourth one down from the top!! "" Dad replying ""No,  not there"" Next time I went over,  I opened his computer and found the Amazon wish list immediately. Fourth option down from the top~~All the time

Me: do you have the 4 digit pin for your account 

Customer: password12

Me: no it's a 4 digit pin, it's 4 numbers

Customer: 123456

Me: no it's only 4 numbers, if you don't know it we can try another way to secure the account 

Customer: &lt;rant&gt; it's me John Doe, it's my account that should be enough I don't remember my pin

My favorite is when they manage to secure the account another way and I offer to change the pin to something ""easier to remember"" and they almost all decline

I did have not a few different people in the past couple months give me a ""new pin"" that was the pin already on the account (not one of the multiple wrong pins they gave me)~~I think like once a week, I have one particular user who likes to report, ""WE'RE DOWN!"" When I ask what they mean, they say, ""THE SYSTEM!"" That's as far as they can elaborate. 

It can mean anything, and it means something different every time. Mostly user error. Drives me crazy. Especially when she yells it within earshot of the company president and his panties get all in a bunch when he thinks his company is falling apart. ~~I feel your pain! I spent alot of years doing tech support for tv, internet, cellphones.

Even in my current job if someone doesn't know basic stuff about how to get to our website and how to find certain menus etc I really wish I could tell them we're not here to teach you how to use a computer.~~Don't even get me started on old people and passwords. I have a million stories  from my time working tech support for a website for 65 &amp; older health insurance. They try to make the password super hard so people don't hack into their account but they can never remember. They question every error like ""passwords do not match"", or ""password does not meet the requirements.""

Spent 30 minutes with a lady that couldn't get her password to meet our guidelines or match because the password was like Ds34$hF245gh. Finally I was like enter medicare$1 and bam it worked. She was like how'd you do that. Well I followed our requirements and I made it easy enough to remember to be able to type it twice to match. It's simple when you follow directions and read. ~~If this is The ecf system and I added a party incorrectly, youd never see me solving it on my own. Thered be a phone call to make sure Im not suing the wrong person, or representing the wrong person, and if I am, that I can at least say I called the help desk.~~When I worked in satellite TV, there was many a customer who would press buttons on the phone instead of the remote control.

Also as step 1 of troubleshooting, you ask ""what do you see on the screen? 

I learned that when the client said ""I see nothing"", it meant they saw
-a blue screen
-a black screen
-a grey screen with writing on it. Which is not my definition of nothing.~~I genuinely believe some people do not posses the ability to look at something, anything honestly, and objectively take in what they're seeing, describe it, and act on what they're seeing. This phenomenon seems to transcend age and any describable demographic from what I can tell. Put simply, some people are just plain fucking stupid best I can tell.....~~Hmm, that's a tough one. Reading that story, I can kind of sympathize with the caller having to jump through all these hoops to finally be allowed to ask her urgent question. To be honest, I wouldn't know those verification questions from the top of my head either, so I can see where that lady got lost. Still, it sucks that you're the one who has to relay the message that you can't help her at this time.

Good luck in your new job!~~Congrats on the new job! I commiserate with how strictly you have to adhere to verification (also in a banking CC.) Customers come in hot and want to bypass the verification...but god forbid their accounts WERE compromised due to lax verification - that's when we become ""useless"" and whatever number of insults could get hurled at us. I would be rightfully pissed if my bank didn't fully verify me.

We want to excuse the elderly so much for their frustrations and unfamiliarity with technology/security but the truth is there are plenty of tech-savvy and kind elderly folks out there. I'm done excusing everyone based on their age. We are all different...no need for her to be rude, even if she's flustered. You are there to help..~~Last week I was in the office of a new job, and I couldn't get a connection on their wifi. Tried both of their networks, tried my phone as a hotspot, etc.  Nothing was working.  Then I remembered... at home I had assigned a static IP to my Macbook because I was using it as a server for compiling iOS Apps.  Surprise, surprise, everything worked fine after I switched back to DHCP.~~I get so many calls about signing in/up with our online account, I'm not even tech support just billing but it gives our number if there is an issue. It's worse now because the site was updated and it used to say enter the first 8 digits of the customer reference but now it doesn't it just shows an example that noone notices apparently.

I will often sign up for people just to save the agro.~~I had a whole supervisor tell me once that sometimes it's that they heard you but they don't like the way you said something or what you said so their brain writes it off. I handle call one request at a time and if they want me to repeat more than five times I politely repeat situation and ask was there anything else I can do for you?~~","The commenter sympathizes with the frustration of dealing with complex and confusing customer service representatives. They express frustration with the inability to reset passwords without a phone call, as well as the lack of communication from the representative. They also mention their own experience of dealing with difficult customer service representatives in the past."
12.0,"I had it the opposite way. I worked for an entertainment company, and there were way too many parents who created accounts for their children. The parents would use their email and their birthday on the account for their child. To make it worse, a lot of times, credit cards would be attached to the account. If the age on account is 18+, then all purchases are open and possible. Then little shithead would charge up the parent's card and I would get to hear about it.~~I had a guy tell me this morning that he's an important executive and his time is valuable and he doesn't have time to wait in queue for a call from a tech and it's disrespectful that a tech isn't the one who answers the phone and we can't help him RIGHT NOW.~~Called my insurance company recently and they had two very specific ID verification questions. I was impressed with the level of security and mentioned that to the representative after verification. Long pause, thenuh, thank you for saying that. We usually just get yelled at for these questions.


Id much rather answer a couple questions than have my account hacked.~~I did 90% password reset for a bank and my lord it drove me crazy. How are u not able to reset a password yourself. I used to be on the phone 30 mins plus with some ppl. Never in my days have I had issues resetting my own pw. I thought it would be an easier department but ppl sent me crazy ~~I used to work in a contact center for a major cell company. 
When we asked for verifcation we would say ""Can I have your 6 to 10 digit PiN"" if that failed then back up of Oh I see your Security question is xxxxx.


I called employee care one day the girl asked me for my 6 digit pin code. So I gave her only the first 6 digits of my 8 digit code. 
""oh that didn't work, can you verify that? ""

""Would you like the whole eight digits""  She didn't think it was as funny as I did; but then I guess that is why you should follow a script. I still gave her a 5 on her survey~~The best is when they interrupt you just to say something useless and asinine like ""Listen, you've got to understand, I didn't grow up with all this stuff. In my day it was X and Y!"" Ok... that changes literally nothing.. it's still step A, B and C to resolve your issue. ~~Urg, that's a frustrating call. I can understand what she's asking by ""can I email it to myself and then print it?"" But she still has to get to a computer that's connected to a printer for that.

So much easier to just print the ticket at the airport. Why do some people make things so complicated?~~I feel your pain. Same shit at my call center. 
It doesn't matter that the username and password are the same for both our website to see your vehicle, our app to control your vehicle, or the rewards website for your vehicle. I still get people asking do I need to create a new account for the rewards site... No you've already been enrolled because you were a member of the website and the app. So what's my password and username? Are you fucking kidding me!? Its the same as the app...WHICH APP?!?! slams fists and pushes the mute so hard the button gets stuck. Fml.~~One thing I love about my center is that all of my dispatchers are allowed to hang up on people who are belligerent/rude/wasting time. In &gt;10 years I've never had to give someone a warning for hanging up inappropriately. My boss when I started backed me up on every complaint about hanging up on abusive or unreasonable callers as well. 

I've had unreasonable reps call back from police and fire agencies demanding that we do something we legally can't do and then start screaming about it. When those calls escalate to me, I advise them that the complaint department is only open on the fifth Thursday of every month from 23:57-23:59 and they can call back at that time. My operations director laughed his ass off at those recordings, then sent the recording of the abusive part of the call to the caller's boss.~~Honestly, I hate when logins require me to change my user ID or my password. I used to have to call IT every 90 days when my work computer password expired and make them reset it so that I could continue using the same one. I told them it was either that or I would write it on a post-it note and stick it on my laptop where anyone could see it.~~I wonder if there's some sort of bias here in the calls you're getting - anyone who knows how to use the email reset feature isn't going to call you after all

Shame the number of callers isn't 0 though as it's hardly difficult, especially in a work environment and yet it seems to be accepted that *I'm not good with computers* even though they're almost as important as English and maths~~I was working for a bank whos clientele is mainly business owners and wealthy people over the age of 50. They decided to completely change their online banking platform which meant every single customer had to re-sign up and I was forced to work the helpline. The above conversation was every single call, every single day for a solid 5 months until I left. Its enough to drive anybody insane.~~Aren't people hilarious? Often our documentation goes to peoples junk folders and i am REQUIRED to ask them to check there before we request to have it resent and people dodge that question like the plague "" i checked my e-mails"" ""i looked yesterday"" ""i dont know why that matters"" ""can you have them phone me"" ""I already said I haven't gotten any e-mails""   


When they finally give in and check i would say 60% of the time what they are looking for is sitting there and has been for days.~~Honesty, I'd probably do the same. 

Brain just shuts off when I'm extremely stressed, tired or hungry and I make so many stupid mistakes. Can't imagine having to deal with the fact that I'll have one less arm for the rest of my life. My brain would probably be soup too and I'd need someone to give me verbal instructions on how to get dressed or something so I don't screw it up.~~""But you said I can use XYZ.""

Fuck the feels are real with this one.  For me it's ""unplug the power cord.""

""Ok I unscrewed it.""

""That's the satellite cord, please unplug the power cord.""

""Which one is that?""

""The one that give the box power...""

""So the satellite cord.""

*internally screaming*~~This shit right here is why everyone should be able to hang up on callers. It does not matter how much you help the person, chances are they will no be able to make it work and will need to visit a branch office to have someone do everything for them.~~A customer once sent their credit card info through normal email and asked if we could add it to their account.. I politely said no and deleted the email. Jeez.

Oh, and when buying monthly subscriptions people don't read the pop-up saying hey, this is automatically renewing, and get mad when they get charged after the one month.~~As frustrating as it is (and I know the pain) it's all worthwhile knowing you helped an elderly person with what they deem to be a difficult task. More often than not, they're super apologetic and are lovely people.

I was always glad when I got a call like this and not an irate customer not accepting that their policy was cancelled because *they* didn't pay.~~I appreciate what you have to go through. Its really too bad security questions are so awful. You either have a short list of questions you are forced to use that either have commonly known or easy to fond out answers, or they just dont apply to you, or questions so obscure you might not answer them consistently... then there is the car question that wont accept a 2 or 3 letter answer...~~There are situations at my call centre where verifying an identity document *in addition* to regular security questions becomes a requirement to access the record. Sometimes the reason is completely independent of the client and what they're calling about.

We can't tell them the reasoning for this though as it's a breach of security protocols, so they often get mad *especially* when I can't get the ID to verify.~~Maybe just emphasize at the end of the sentence. ""May I have your email address?  And please note, I'm asking only for your email address, not your email password."" A bit lengthy but still shorter than what that ""change your email password"" conversation probably adds to the end of your call.~~I have a former actual friend who deleted her Facebook ... the logged on for her birthday.  I just felt that fit here a little.  I also felt a little bad for her that she was so attention starved that she seemingly reactivated Facebook for the virtual love and kindness instead of accepting actual love and kindness.  For the record, she ended our friendship.  

Sorry about your crummy call! ~~I love the ones that dont want to give you info. My go to is You dont have to answer any of these questions, however if you dont I cant help you and youll need to come into a branch.
I have yet to have anyone hang up and come in. ~~That would be a lovely piece of technology, though. A system that passes info over when callers punch it in during the call? Yes please! 

Or at the least, when the IVR has already asked them for order number, etc, if it could, yknow, pass that info to me so I dont have to get it again? Thatd be great.~~Welcome to my world fruit person  I'm so done already. When I cant figure it out I refer to manufacturer. Setting up emails on the fruit phone pisses me off so much I always give up and tell them to go to fruit. How can I remote in and successfully set it up every time but you cant?!?!~~I try my best to approach these calls with empathy and kindness. Its given me a lot of opportunities to actually help our clients understand technology better, which gives me some sense of purpose in such a pointless job. Luckily we have no handle time requirements and my company encourages this. Sometimes though I wish people knew their limits. This is why so many seniors are victims of cyber crime. If you cant manage to create a username and password you probably shouldnt be putting your financial information online.~~We have policy that if you tell IT SUPPORT your password then we will reset it for you on the spot.

Our systems then enforce  a ""first time = forced client reset"" login so the user has to set a new password. No it can't be one of the last 20 used, must be 8+ and 3of4 character types. 

Oh and to the user who thought they could cycle through 20 passwords in one day to get back to their favourite. Only one end-user triggered password change / day.

So the first thing users learn is to NOT tell us what their password is or they encounter our ""you told us stuff .. we give you a free reset"" policy.~~","The commenter used to work for an entertainment company where parents would create accounts for their children and credit cards would be attached to the account.

12.0,"I work at a call center for an ISP.  We frequently get calls for email password resets.  Before we can process any changes though, we have to verify the caller's ID, obviously.  the fist question I ask always seems to be the hardest one for the callers to answer: ""What city are you calling from?""

You'd think it would be a VERY easy question to answer, but over 90% of the callers will have me repeat the question, and then ask me what I mean...

I even preface it by saying ""Let's bring up your account,"" so they should be aware that I'm looking for basic information.~~I know that feeling.. I get calls ALL DAY LONG, with people's crack pot suggestions, on how we need to improve this, or that.. I'm just like.. ""Suuuuureeee... I'll definitely make sure that information gets passed along""... Than I proceed to go about the rest of my day, as if nothing happened.

No. There's literally no more image. 


A lady today still didn't get it after a half-dozen staff explained it in a number of different ways. Best part is, she's a pro photographer who has printed thousands of images with us. ~~You'd be amazed how many people don't know what a browser is. Loading a simple URL is like pulling teeth.

Easy to memorize, and they have alpha-numeric-symbolic built in, and have enough digits.  Or bible verse structure applied to other books.  Cos12:14  (Chamber of Secrets chapter 12 paragraph 14) is a fine password.

I make accounts from obscure characters in books no one reads, sometimes combined with nicknames from years ago.

~~I had an issue with a program for our accounting so I sat down and called the company, I could tell the poor guy was having a rough day.  After he answered he asked if I could hold on for a second, I heard him mutter something under his breath and then he explained what I needed to to fix our problem.  

As Im getting ready to hang up I asked him, what is PEBCAK?   I could hear him stutter and then laugh, it was what he muttered earlier.  Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard.   We both had a laugh.~~This is why when my grandparents get stuck with their fruit items I tell them to call me and I go around to figure it out or remote access it from my house. If I cant figure it out then, I make sure Im there when the call is made to tech support and normally end up speaking on their behalf so I dont make them wanna pull their hair out 

I salute to all of you who deal with this on a daily bases~~Heres how an actual IT person would go about it.

Attempt to replicate issue on a different device. Issue doesnt happen? Its now isolated to the original machine, so you can rule out everything that isnt on the machine (usually, kind of a generalization but you get the gist)

What annoys me is that when I ask, I say 'Could I please get your 6 digit (meaning number) PIN (personal identification number) Number'? 

When I say' Can I get your 6 digit pin number' I'm literally stating that it's a number, 3 times. I also clearly state that it's 6 digits in length. 

Without fail, 70% of the callers say shit like 'is it rabbits79' which not only includes letters, it's not even 6.

It's fucking annoying that grown adults can't follow simple conversation and instruction. ~~""Do you have your account number or 4 digit security code handy?""

""Yeah it's 1234""

""I'm sorry that's not the security code on file""

That would seem like a logical thing for the company to do. It isn't hard to put one in. I'm willing to bet it would cost less to have a website designer take 10 minutes to put that link on than the resources needed to handle hundreds or even thousands (depending on how big the company is) of calls a month to customer service.

No such thing as tablets and we only had two choices of browsers, IE and Netscape. Google was just the new""cool"" search engine.

Customers still had a level of intelligence that was easy to deal with and the ones who had no clue actually listened to your directions to help fix whatever issue they had. No arguments or armchair tech they googled somewhere and thought they knew more than you.

Now it's desktops and tablets. iOS, windows, Android or, dare I say it, Linux, and they have no clue what they are using.

I'd have a permanent dent in my forehead from banging my head to the desk if I did any sort of tech support now.~~Sir can you press the home button in the top left corner? 

Im logged out now.

Okay sir, you need to log back into your account 

So youre telling me I have to log in to get to my account?

........yes 

This was my favorite call from yesterday. Haha trying to help people access the web services we provide isnt that bad except this guy was appalled that he had to log in. ~~Jesus. Everytime I read one of these, I'm suddenly feeling very loving toward my employers. I may work for the government, and I may have to be annoyingly pleasant to people who annoy the crap of me. But if they're rude, we're allowed to give as good as we get without any repreccusuons.~~I had a fellow employee call me once. I was in HR, not IT, by the way. She couldn't turn on her computer. She couldn't find the power button. It took 10 minutes on the phone to help her find the power button. Big. On the front of the tower. Where it's always been. I would have saved more time to walk across campus and do it for her. And her job meant she was on the computer all day every day, not like she never logged on.~~We have the same issue with sign up and log in. I literally spent over an hour on chat trying to talk someone through logging in and they kept trying to sign up and were getting mad that it was telling them that there was already an account under that email. Some people.~~Our customers have a similar problem when starting the 2FA app for the first time. The app clearly tells them to set a password. And they keep calling to ask how they'll get this code because their online banking PIN doesn't fit. How nice this job could be if customers actually read instructions.~~","The commenter works at a call center for an ISP and often receives calls for email password resets, but they have to verify the caller's ID before they can process any changes.

12.0,"don't get me started, some people have like 10 accounts and they can only use 1 for that particular service we provide. The hardest part is logging them out and logging them back in with the correct login smh. 

yesterday I had someone who literally couldn't read, and I had to explain what the button looks like and how many letters are in the word ""log-out"" and ""login"".~~People are allergic to any self service option, period. I get so much backsass from asking people with tech issues what troubleshooting they've already done. ""It's not my job to troubleshoot! It's yours!"" 

Okay, ya big baby, let's have a tech visit set up every time your WiFi goes out for 5 minutes because you haven't reset your modem in 2 years. Good call!~~I feel you. I usually understand having to repeat myself twice, thrice if I feel like the person who I'm speaking with is old or has some sort of issue. We have to remember that many times the things that we say don't register with the person we are speaking with the first time, so it makes sense that sometimes we have to repeat ourselves. After all, who among us is able to fully grasp what someone else is saying first try, especially if it's something we are unfamiliar with and during a time of high stress?

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, if I have said the same thing 3 times and you are still asking the same question, I assume you are not paying attention and are just wasting my time.~~","The commenter explains that some people have multiple accounts and can only use one for certain services, making it difficult to log them out and logging them back in with the correct login. They also mention that people are allergic to self-service options. The commenter also shares their experience of having to repeat themselves"
13.0,"I used to work in a call center and I vividly remember this call I had with a customer. It was a 4 hour call of calling another place trying to get the persons issue resolved. And everyone we got someone they would transfer us to someone else. I somehow ended back to my workplace at one time during the call. It was wild but if they don't know instead of finding an answer they shove the problem to the next person until there isn't anyone but another company. It's really frustrating.~~Saw something kinda similar. Notes from the tech said customer was a hoarder, everything covered in cockroaches, customers had several aggressive small dogs that could not be contained, etc. Notes say the tech had to leave to fucking vomit and he called his manager to suspend the job. She then proceeded to call in and complain that he was rude and didnt finish the job and she wanted to know why.~~In many centers, you have to sit there and take the abuse. 

Then the abusive caller will get a survey to say what she thinks of you. 

After that, your bosses will listen to the call, trying to figure out what you did to make a valued customer so upset. 

Finally, you and your coach/manager/team leader will have a talk about how you need to improve your call handing, so that you can build better rapport with customers like that one. 

The QA notes will also reveal you did not use a proper call closing script, forgot to make at least two promotional offers, and failed to use the caller's name three times.~~Im reminded of my first major job out of college. It was at a distance learning company. At one point the owner fired the only black employee. He was ecstatic and bragged about how this meant they could stay open on MLK day but that the sales staff needed to make certain not to make any outgoing calls to black sounding names.~~Gotta' love the lawyer card. If anything when someone mentions a lawyer in a threat it makes me take them less seriously. We've all heard it in customer service way too many times. People threatening to lawyer up over the most Petty and insignificant things. Some law firm out there must be making a killing. Morgan and Morgan, 4 the people!~~I feel this. I'm a call center supervisor and I try to be as nice and patient as I can when I have to call one myself. The problem is, I have a very hard time with strong accents, I just can't understand them sometimes.

 When I set up my current Internet service, the man who answered the phone had a strong South African accent and spoke so fast. I realized that I was still trying to mentally process how to pronounce his name and he was three sentences past that. I apologized and handed the phone off to my husband, who's much better at understanding accents than I am. The guy was awesome, knowledgeable and helpful, but my brain just couldn't keep up.~~""Can't you put me in the front of the queue?""

What?  Why would there even be an implemented physical system to do that?  And why would you think that's a thing that exists?

If you think that we'd reserve a VIP route for someone to reach a certain team ahead of the plebs...  don't you think that would be a separate phone number?  GTFO of here with that.~~Oh my god yes. We are a Christian based software company (I work support lines) and the ONLY day we are closed are Sundays (and the ocassional holiday- Christmas eve, Christmas, 4th of July) and people constantly get mad asking why were closed on Sundays. Sunday is the ONLY day off we get during tax season...~~Couldn't have said it better, friend. I personally do my job to the best of my ability, not out of fear of retribution, but because at the end of that call, when that person asks me ""What is your extension so I can get you next time"" (even though I have to tell them we have no extensions), that remark is the reason I work as hard as I do. When customers - real people - recognize the effort I put in to helping them and give praise where praise is due, the world just feels like a better place.

On the other hand, most jack-offs that call in can go bite one, but I help them nonetheless. ~~This reminds me of the story of a call center tech who couldn't get a woman to unplug a cable, so they told her to spin it over her head to get all the jammed up bits inside out, then plug it back in.

It worked for her, even if it seemed foolish.~~I chuckled at this. I totally get how funny it is, and how seemingly harmless. BUT, after watching my mom, who is one of those slightly gullible older people, recover from a stroke and a divorce, learning to do everything all over again at age 75, and mastering all this technology...She takes notes on everything so people don't have to repeat themselves and she's become the queen of Twitter. She DVRs like a pro, fixes her own computer problems...most of the time...and it just seems cruel for that guy to have been pranking folks like her who are doing their best to learn about the systems they have. Don't mean to be a spoilsport, but screw that guy.~~A similar situation happened to me with a customer. Two years ago a rep disconnected the customer's account instead of just putting it on seasonal as requested since it was a second vacation residence. Also, a physical disconnection never occurred for some reason. Customer only had cable with no stb so they never noticed. Currently my company is undergoing an all digital transition so now they begin losing channels and decide to call in. I pull up the address and see that the account is not active. Through investigation I begin to understand what has happened. I questioned the customer if they thought it was weird that they never received a bill for this address in the mail. They also believed it was bundled into their main address???

I informed them that they had received free services for about two years. This person was cool about it though and requested a re-connection. Customer was okay w/ price and I got a sale out of it!!~~Back in my retail days, I worked the cable desk at the (now defunct) big red Canadian media conglomerate video rental store.  Regularly people would come in to clarify ask why they were charged for On-Demand rentals.  All regular content listed the title, and no one would ever ask about those.  For adult content, the description was a generic ""On-Demand Movie Rental"".  

One day, this man came in demanding to know what the movies were.  I tried to be discreet and simply say ""adult movies"", but he wasn't having any of it.  He was adamant that no one in his house would order such smut.  Eventually, I relented and told him the titles of the hardcore hunk on hunk movies.  He then calmly asked what time they were ordered.  When I advised, he calmly stated ""I always suspected he was"".  

I brought a father to the realization that his son liked men.~~Some absolute *idiot* from Netflix customer support did this to me. They had charged the customer for 2 accounts and wanted me to credit back what they had double charged. I explained to them that would be on them... we are an isp and they use the internet to access Netflix but Netflix charged them for both accounts, we never saw a penny ... also the from what she was saying the customer did kind of set up and keep paying 2 different accounts so...


Ok well the customer has already been on the line and mother fucker drops off!!! The customer came on to explain she had been on the phone 2 hours just trying to close one of the 2 accounts and during wrap up asked for credit back on one of the accounts. So the rep instead of just either saying no or giving the mf 35 dollars it would even have been  decided it would be better to navigate  through an entire different companies automated system and dump the call~~I moved from loyalty to data support. I love that the threats to cancel mean jack diddly to me now. Oh I'm sorry i can't help with that, let me get your service going for now and if you decide to leave ill be sorry to hear it but in the mean time you should have working Internet. When they realize the that isn't getting them anywhere with me, the nastiness stops and they actually ts with me. I have never once had to transfer someone to loyalty~~I love hearing the lawyer card.  Our company takes legal action fairly seriously and the call would go like this,
 
Sir, since you have stated that you may be seeking legal council against our company, I am no longer able to discuss your issue and I am obligated to provide you the contact information for our legal department, do you have a pen handy?~~Surveys have become a disease.  Everywhere I go, they want a survey.  Restaurant?  Survey.  Grocery store?  Survey.  *Doctor's office?* Fucking survey.

Used to be, you'd hire a company, get a survey, and that'd be it.  Now, instead of having internal controls on staff and management, they throw it all out into surveys to their customers for every single transaction.  Shit questions, shit controls on respondents, shit results.  And heaven forbid you get less than the absolute top score; you must suck at your job.

For the most part, I refuse to fill them out.  I refuse surveys after making calls to customer service centers.  The last time I actually filled out a survey was for a franchised ice cream store, and I only did it because it needed a renovation badly.  Three months later, the store got renovated.~~How did he not have police at his doorstep for threatening to kill and rape you?

At all call centers I worked in (even the worst ones) that kind of talk was instant grounds to have the police go to their address (you know where they are) and do a ""Welfare Check"" and/or arrest if they continue to be belligerent and threatening.

It would also be grounds to have them ""dis-invited"" as customers; AKA go somewhere else for your cable as that kind of abuse is inexcusable.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have disconnected accounts for rude people that were told ""No"" and called back over and over until someone just did it due to lack of fortitude.~~I work in a call center for a cable company and I love getting calls where people have been getting channels that weren't in their package. Either they had some service codes that shouldn't have been on the account in the first place or, with certain packages, they never had a limited filter placed on their line. It's so satisfying to advise them that they were receiving these channels for free and if they want them again they need to pay. ~~","The commenter used to work in a call center and had a bad experience with a customer who was abusive.

lol. I had some lady 2 months ago like that:

Me: Thank you for calling GaVerse my name is Mindy I'll be your resolution specialist. How may I help you?

Mrs. YouOweMe: Yes, who do I send my tax return to?

Me: I'm sorry what? (I literally take a doubletake every time I get one of these satanic loons on the phone)

Her: I use my internet to run a business and my business makes 1200 per day. I've been out for 5 days now, I want to know who can I send my tax returns to to get my money.

What kind of DUMBASS pays for a RESIDENTIAL account and expects to get REIMBURSED for home internet???
~~I had a similar one back in the day.. used to work business services for a big ol cable company.  
When i got another job later, bought a house, and ordered my own internet the sent a tech. He stopped by and put the modem in, and asked that I sign his work order.  
""Sure, i just want to run a speed test first.""  
""Oh, well, they're not accurate at time of install. It can take 24 hours to load the proper bin file.""  
""HAHAHA! That's a good one. I was actually one of the internal beta testers for this very modem. I had write access to the CMTS. I've pushed more Bin files to these modems than you have. would you care to change your answer?""~~Back in the mid 80s i had cable with all the channels including hbo showtime etc.

But they always played movies that i already had on tape,  so i called and canceled the premium channels.

Couple weeks later, still had the channels so called again. Then they sold to a different company.

Long story short

Still had the channels , but wasnt billed for them~~Stepping over dollars to pick up pennies.  Given that the cable box would likely use about 7kWH per month, they are wasting hundreds of dollars to save between 35 and 75 per month.  What a moron.

It is like the people I deal with with DSL who turn off their modem when they aren't using it, to save money.  But it prevents us from pushing firmware updates overnight, so they will sometimes turn on their modem, and have to wait 10 minutes for the update to process.  And again, all over saving 63 (using local power costs).~~I've come pretty close before, especially when dealing with a person who SCREAMS into the phone. There is just no reason for anyone to do that, honestly, and it makes me really angry (and gives me a headache). 

When dealing with an idiot who won't take **NO** for an answer, I usually just repeat the same phrase over and over again, in a soft but firm voice. Eventually they either get so frustrated/angry that they hang up on me, or they realize that I am not going to do what they want me to do, and allow me to transfer them (or whatever is the correct action). Being able to manipulate an asshole jerk into exploding into a fit of rage when I am being calm and polite is one of the perks of my job. I absolutely love it, and it gets rid of them anyhow, which was my goal to begin with. You can't reason with stupid....~~Probably because the son has bad credit or a bad history with your company and can't get his own service.  A lot of places will just close out accounts once they discover the acct holder died.  He didn't want to lose the service, but thought he would when you heard ""dad died"".~~Oh man that almost made ME cry. Im pretty jaded at this point but yes there are definitely some people who I make a connection with and go above and beyond to help. They are pretty rare though but some people just have such sad stories that make my cold dead heart  wake. 

I had a lady who owed us for equipment that her ex husband destroyed on purpose. He was abusive and she literally had to run in the middle of the night to get away from him. She was living in a shelter and had no money for food let alone internet equipment. 

I did everything I could and asked whoever I could think of to waive it for her but no one would. She ended up sobbing and hung up. She totally couldve been making it all up to get out of paying but I really believe she wasnt. Made me pretty ticked off at my management since I NEVER asked them before or since to do anything like that. ~~Sometimes you just have to take off your headset and wait until you don't hear talking or yelling anymore then wait a little bit longer til you hear, ""hello? Hello?"" Then come back with whatever you were going to say completely ignoring the temper tantrum. I suspect that's how parents treat their toddlers.~~At a certain point in the conversation you just want to go, ""Okay lady, what are you looking to get out of this?""  If the company has any kind of retention policy (these are the scourge of the earth and may they burn in the 20th level of hell for all eternity) you can either help these people or not.  

One of the best days of my life is the day I realized I didn't have to talk to the ""customer"" directly any longer.  Jobs like this teach you diplomacy at the expense of ulcers.~~Customer called me once with the same issue.  She was at work, didn't want to trouble shoot the issue, wanted a new box.  After five minutes of back and forth on this I conseeded and told her that I would go ahead and send a new box to her:

Me:  Ok, I will have that order set up for you.  I will just need your Credit Card number for the purchase.

Cust:  What do you mean purchase?  I want a new box.

Me:  And I am sending you one, but because you are not going to help me here, I am just going to send you one a bill you for it.  Or you could call us back when you get home and we can see if it is something that could be replaced for free.

Cust:  CLICK -- Dial tone.~~I love when they complain that the data on on their phone is running slow since they used up all the high speed data and I offer them say something like unlimited high speed for $20 more and the flip out. ""WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR MORE DATA!"" Bro, that's how life works. You have to pay more money to get more service, this isn't a charity. Then they usually go on about how I'm going to fix their slow data...um the only way is by upgrading your package. How do these people function in real life? I can see these fucks going to McDonalds asking to make their meal a large and flipping the fuck out since they have to pay more to get more food.~~Working from home was great for these calls. I had someone get so upset with me specifically because his wife found charges for dirty phone lines on their bill that he wished harm on my entire family. In the office, you just take it. Working from home, it gets a bit more personal.

Amazing how quickly they lose that facade when you point out that they've wished harm on a 4 year old, who is in the room, and it's now been recorded. Thankfully the UK and our company have some teeth and that dudes address is now blacklisted from every major telecoms provider~~It absolutely defrosts the deepest curls of my bowels when a customer states that they won't be paying their final bill. I just imagine the sheer perfection of the ramroding they're going to receive from our collection agencies. 

People act like it's simple to not pay your final bill... They act like we're going to have to take them to court if we want to recover anything. One, we're willing to, but second, we have multibillion dollar partnerships with agencies that just do not give a fuck about whether you're satisfied, they follow the law to the letter with regards to collection attempts, and will do everything in their power to scrub clean your wallet with the high-power pressure-wash of your valid final bill. 

So whenever people scream at me that they're not going to pay their early termination fee, or that they're not going to pay for something they broke and chose to return.... I just sit back and imagine.~~Im finding this hilarious. Some people have way too much time on their hands. 

A relative of mine works for NHS direct (for non UK people our NHS the medical facility giving us free health care has a non emergency line. If your not sure whats wrong with you or a person with you and need medical advice you ring the number and a trained member of staff will take your symptoms and assess if you need a doctor, can go to a pharmacy and in extreme cases will dispatch an ambulance to you.) anyway they was once telling me how someone one rang them up, repeatedly and quizzed them on things like ""how many ribs should a person have?"" And other random biology questions. ~~My client relations department once responded to a legal threat like this: we are a multi-billion dollar corporation. I can guarantee you that my lawyer is better than yours. That guy is my hero at work. He has no problem putting a jerk in their place when protecting the company. ~~Lmao. This reminds me of the time a Latino man asked me to do something against our policies and was like You are so racist, you treat all your Latino customers like this and I was like Eh, sir, Im latina too, Im not being racist, we just cant do anything, chill~~When it came down to it the second I clocked in I was a face for the company. One of many that answered the same number. Chances are I was able to do everything you needed. In the odd chance I personally couldn't we would get a ticket in for the issue and get back to you if it was you/your account related. I never would personally apologize because all I did was follow policies as they intended me to like a good company drone. Then I clocked out and became a human again.

That was the only way I was able to live in the call center universe.~~Find another job, ASAP - It sounds like you still have a kind, customer service oriented heart and a cable service place will eat your soul.

If you enjoy CS and don't have a phone allergy, I'd look into one of the Big Airlines. The perks are amazing, the training is thorough (but tough - there's a lot to learn) BUT you actually have a lot of tools and often have a bit more leeway than being stuck 'On Script'.

Why can't I take my modem with me to Target and still get internet~~ITS LIKE YOU PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ME! LOL!!! I had a very similar call shortly after - apparently I'm a billing agent today.... the guy was pissed because he is moving to an area we do not service. He then finds out that in cancelling his account he will owe us an additional $300 in fees due to cancelling his contract. then gives me a very, very, VERY long winded sob story about how he was told this and this and this about his agreement (basically arguing the length of his SIGNED contract)..... I then stated we would review the original call and physical contract.... Surprisingly the customer instantly had a change of heart. YES, YOUR CALL IS RECORDED AND MONITORED FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE. ~~Yeah, I once had a women asking for a 6 months credit for her cell phone data. No calls or nothing to us about it at all in six months. Basically, she walked into a store six months ago added data to her account and until the phones is rebooted, or looses cell service for a bit the towers don't update with the system to see that her phone now has the data code on it. So... six months of no calls to us or complain to the or turned her phone one or off, or even loose service for a bit. Got her to put her phone in airplane mode for about 5 seconds and then full data bars. Denied her a refund and then to send her to tier 2.~~My thing is why couldn't he clean it up? Why does he need to wait on the wife to do it? I'm sorry, but a man who calls a woman a 'cunt' for ANY reason is not someone I would want around my niece or really any female I know. That alone tells you everything you need to know and we're it me, I would've hung up on him.~~I'm a telecoms engineer. I asked a customer to leave their router on constantly for 8 days, (VDSL broadband in the UK, every time the router is turned off the DLM sees it as a fault and will lower the speed, over time this reduces it to unusable) When they refused as the electricity would cost them, I stood there and calculated it would cost around 30p, and offered them the amount in cash. They tried to make a complaint as I was rude...~~I had the opposite CS experience, in effect. After every single answer to her questions she would reply, ""Thank you so very much for this information!"" Example:

CS: ""Please confirm your street address.""

Me: 123 Main Street.

CS: ""Thank you so very much for this information!""

Every. Fucking. Answer. Took forever to run that gauntlet.~~Just like loyalty for customers means little these days, same for employees. No reason to stay at a company when it reaches the point of no return 

I take calls for the largest cell phone carrier in the US and we have suspicion it's going to be getting worst. Before we had this yes no system that was easier to bonus with, but it was also screwed up.

Example: Rep was great, company sucks! 

Sounds like what you have?  The part of the survey for you never counted towards your score, only the part for the company.

We have a 1 to 10 score now and while the weight is now towards you vs the company, anything below a 9 is a fail. There's rumors going on that the company part is going to start factoring in which is the day I'm giving my 2 weeks notice.~~Lmao sounds like a certain cable company I used to work for. My favorite was when they cut the cable line then got pissed we wouldnt send anyone out immediately. Like you cut it..? You have to wait for the next available tech. And then if I escalated it to dispatch to try for a sooner appt and dispatch didnt have one I got to deal with you NEED to get me a sooner appt! And then when I said well dispatch is the only one who can get a sooner appt and unfortunately theyre completely booked, you currently have the soonest appt available. Then it got to I want your manager. Those were always so fun.~~I think you did what you had to do.  I'm in a call center myself and sometimes these people just... don't.. get it.  They have the tendency to think that just because they are on the phone they can be rude as shit. Or they really are just stupid.  

And I think we all know... You just can't fix stupid.~~Not sure what I can say to that but technology these days takes away common sense... As a customer I had before helping with a wifi issue, I told him to go to where the modem (gateway) is. He asks ""All I see is Chrome, go there?"" No, it's the modem, the physical device, its a big tower like box. CX: (dead silence as it seems I'm talking in mandarin) ""I still don't know what you're talking about, I see chrome here on my laptop"" Even the son was near the ""What modem?"" question. ~~As someone who telecommutes I understand the frustration, however the first question I asked of my provider was if the service would meet my needs (and I provided the technical details). If he didn't do that, or if he just assumed it would be fine for work , the repercussions are on him.~~This is what I don't understand.  There's never any reason to lie.  Just be honest.  You can get away with being not-nice (not mean, but just not being nice).  You can get away with not kissing the customer's ass.  You can get away with long call times.  You can get away with so much so long as you're honest.~~I've worked for a call center for basically the same company... I've weathered CBS/Showtime, fox networks disputes while a retention sup...

Or drop a channel that is in dispute causing them to break their package just to find out that 1&amp;2 were valid and now they are paying full price for the services and the rep noted in the account in professional terms that we would be saying ""I told you so"" within a week.and oh, you ain't getting that discount back... 

I don't miss those days...


Blotto~~I've seen that scroll going on. I've been around long enough that the scroll never tells the full story, just the one side.

""Oh, look at the big bad cable company. **We're** being nice guys and holding the line on costs or even reducing them"".

Yeah, right. When it is all said and done I'll bet my cable bill is a few dollars higher.~~Whoa. Not cool.  ""Thank you for the offer but it's not necessary. Thank you for calling have a nice day"". 

If you have to get a ""no"" response after asking if they anything else and customer says something inappropriate, I'd guess that you shouldn't get dinged for responding with ""that's outside of our business model, thank you for calling have a great day"" click.~~Sounds like it's better for that person to mark down that they transferred a call than they finished a call with no resolution.

I work as a travel agent and have had airlines (one in particular but not naming) dump calls on me before, some of which weren't even booked through us which means we can't even see it...

Edit: tense~~Because most people are self entitled cunts who feel that they should get the best treatment and if anything in their tiny microcosm is tilled ever so slightly then it is the fault of someone else and that just happens to be the poor tech who happened to answer the phone late one night.   ~~I just want internet, but when I ask why my bill is so high they tell me I can sign up for cable TV service and my bill will go down. What the hell is that about? If only restaurants worked that way. The more I order the less I pay. ~~I get this all the time with phone repairs.

""IF YOU DONT DO x THEN I WILL CANCEL MY CONTRACT"" 

Or some variation on ""DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I PAY PER MONTH FOR THIS CONTRACT?""

Actually sir, your contract has nothing to do with us, it's between you and the network.

We're just the manufacture of your phone.

Please try again as my give a fuck meter raised approx 0.

Also the morons signing two year contracts and not taking out extra cover after the first year for the device. That's not my fault! You knew you had a two year contract, for which you pay a ridiculous amount of money per month, but it never crossed your mind to take out any cover?

13.0,"I've snapped at a user before because he was giving me such attitude and was like ""fix my computer"". I'd ask ""what's wrong with your computer?"" and he just said ""i don't know, just fix it""... So I also snapped and afterwards he apologised and we actually talked about it like adults about how we both could have worded it differently. It was so strange, but it ended ok. ~~So when you say cable box, do you mean the set top box for the TV, or a combo of both set top box and modem?

If it is the former, he really is a moron.

If it is the latter, it seems rather silly that you can't manually reset your modem~~About the only thing different about ""Business Accounts"" is higher bandwidth, symmetrical U/D, or static IPs. I can imagine it being true that someone *wouldn't* need any of those features and still be working from home.

If his class of access ""isn't recommended"" for business use, that someone implies that what ever the ""business level"" of account *is* recommended. If that's the case, what differentiates the business account from a standard account? Why would it be recommended over a standard account if someone didn't need all those other features? (i.e., selling things on Amazon, eBay, Etsy, etc)~~That reminds me of the 4chan greentext where OP worked as a rep for Verizon and whenever someone called in for an activation, he told them to hold the phone as high as they can and shout ""ACTIVATE!"" as he sent the activation signal.  He also told them to shout ""ACTIVATE!"" any time they had poor signal to improve it.~~This reminds me of something I saw on an r/askreddit thread where a guy does a service call at Henry Winklers house. Same type of issue, but he told Henry to hit the box. He sent the signal as soon as he convinced him to hit it, and it worked. He got a huge kick out of it. ~~I also work at an ISP and plenty of people try to get a credit for data they used on their phones during an outage. Because we *forced* them use mobile data watch Netflix, YouTube, and Facebook. Their addiction is not my company's problem; they'll get a reasonable credit for the time it's down and maybe something extra for the inconvenience, but no way we're covered $100 in mobile data because Brittany can't put her goddamn tablet down and crack open a book. Or her demonic children can't manage their emotions without watching Frozen for the 487th time.~~I also work at a cable / ISP / telecom provider.  What they don't tell people generally is that there is very little markup on the cable tv service.  At least for the one I work at.  Because the networks charge to be included, and also per viewer, when somebody is paying $100 a month for cable TV with all the channels there's probably $15 a month that goes to profit.  $10 or so of the $100 goes to maintaining the cable boxes, and all the rest goes to the respective networks.

The place most of the companies actually make their money is through telephony or internet since it's just upkeep once the infrastructure is there, aside from type 2 or layer 2 leasing of lines for connectivity.~~When I left a cable provider, my supervisor was to switch my account from employee account to a standard customer account with 350 channels and internet. She didnt do that and I had the employee account for almost two years before they did their audit of employee accounts. They sent me a letter in the mail saying they did the audit and advised me of the account changes. 

Going from $50 month for internet and 350 channels to almost $200 a month was a bit much. Also, as my account was flagged as an employee account, I couldnt make any changes online and had to call in if I wanted to make any changes.

I had zero intention in calling in to them to explain what happened. Needless to say, I dropped the cable and kept my internet.~~I worked call center hell for a major cable company. The sweet old senior citizens were the 1st to go ballistic with cussing and insults. Granted, it did not help that our script did not include the taxes and fees which is understandable but the fees were $ 20. They would go rage nuclear over that fee !  Normal people understand taxes but fees...never.~~The comments that we get sometimes. The one that kinda stings a bit is (when it is not true at all) when the customer is not getting their way and say ""you know, you are just being unprofessional"". Well not sure how that could be when all we are doing is trying to process your request. However, I will say mr. customer, your comment of ""it is like you are all chilling at home or something"" did make me laugh a bit afterwards. Well technically you are not wrong, because 70% of those who can are working from home right now!~~As a former cable tec I hated stepping in dog crap in someone's house. 

Yes, I did that once.

No, people leaving this kind of mess is not as uncommon as you would think.

Don't ask about the hairball the cat left behind that the customer cleaned up in front of me, my stomach still turns because of that~~Customer wants tech to reprogram his cordless phone. After informing customer that we do not service a phone we did not supply, customer spent 40 minutes telling me about how things used to be before all the technology and what it was like to be a machinist in the Navy in 1964~~I got written up once for ""being sarcastic"" - I had explained the process for returning an overpayment several times (probably 5 times, step by step, more detailed each time) and the guy kept telling me that I was lying basically.

Finally I said ""Listen, it's not like I have a big cheque book here on my desk that I can just write it out and mail it to you now, you have to follow the process"".  He didn't like that :P~~One of my favorite tactics to use on these kinds of lovely people is to simply go for broke with them. Clearly he's wanting you to promise the moon so he can use that against your employer in the future. Saying something like 
&gt; ""I would love to make that guarantee, but the fact is - I'm telling you the truth. If you would *like* for me to tell you a comfortable lie - I totally could, but you have to understand I'm telling you the truth.""  
  

  That is, if he'd ever let you speak. ~~I have found that these type of people are only calling in to report every little minuscule problem, so they can try to get a credit on their bill.  Sadly, it usually works, so they will just continue that behavior.  

I sometimes get the urge to quit my job, get a list of every asshat that I have talked to that treated me like this, go to their house, tell them how miserable of a person they are, kick them in the shin, and leave.~~thats my biggest pet peeve on the phone. say our company is fraud? fuck you but fine. can deal. be a dick? fuck you but can deal. 

continuously interrupting me for stupid shit instead of letting me answer your question? i turn into gandalf when bilbo accuses him of wanting the ring of power.

edit: also if im bored and people really wont shut up, ill just keep talking until they realize it and stop to hear what im saying. then i just wait.... and wait... then you hear the ""...hello?"" and then call them on it. ""well you mightve heard what i was saying had you stopped interrupting me.""~~Way back when I took calls for Comcast one channel was moved from one package to the next-level higher priced package.

At first, we got lots of calls from customers looking for ""their"" channel and it sucked to have to tell them ""Sorry, it's been moved and if you want it again it'll be X more per month""

After a while most customers got used to the change and stopped calling to inquire/complain. 

Then one day, 6 MONTHS after the channel was moved, I get this guy yelling about how it's his favourite channel and how dare we move it blahblahblah.

Ummm... how did it take you so long to notice if it's your ""favourite""??????~~You should have told her to buy a radio or go to her car and listen to it. Im so glad i got out of the cable business. Best thing in life that ever happens to me. But, if it wasnt for my tech support gig in cable I wouldnt be where I am now. Good luck, hope you get out of there sooner than later.~~I gotta say, I like having schedules set by stats. It means my hard work pays off.  Changing the rating system applies across the board.
So, sure. Your score took a hit, but so did everyones... no?
Dont get me wrong, I know the frustration of bad stats and schedules. But Linda getting the best shift even though her talk time is through the roof just because shes been here for 10 years and doesnt quite suck enough to get fired is bull shit.~~For this exact reason, our supervisors openly go through our chats that have been rated badly and take out ones where we as the agent did everything correctly (we have a 100 point scorecard this gets measured by, too, so there is actually a measure of objectivity with it) but the customer was still pissed because our product doesn't do xyz for free.~~They always want every channel, l mean everything like even international channels that they freely admit dont watch. I dont care if you are retired and are recluse its not humanly possible to watch every single channel.

I also love how they want to remove certain channels. I would always hear

Why dont you just take off the Spanish channels and lower my bill? Im not Spanish, I dont speak that language. Im American!

Or 

Why cant you take off xyz channels? Why are they even in the package?

Because ABC owns XYZ channel mam and contracts they made with  all cable providers stipulated its a bundled deal

Well why dont they make new contract then?

Thats above my and anyone I knows pay grade mam

That usually worked like maybe 70% of the time.~~&gt;I let her know that I wasn't going to try to charge her, because it was a mistake on our end, but I don't know what the Sales policy is.

She cancelled her service. Your company made a mistake and sent her the product for free. She did not have any part in your company's error. She never agreed to any contract for your services. She didn't even know that the product your company sent was normally a fee-based product. Don't you have to have a contract to purchase before you can bill unless she had intentionally done something to cause a theft of services? This sounds more like a gift of services.~~","The commenter had a similar experience with a user who said ""fix my computer"" instead of ""fix my cable box.""

13.0,"The nonsense customers say on the phone.  I had someone tell me, ""I hope you get cancer on Christmas "". Another woman claimed she needed to do a settlement on her credit card because she had life insurance money from her husband dying.  She claimed she couldn't do a lower pmt repayment plan because she was going to be homeless and she had kids. ""We're going to be living under a bridge. Can you send a bill under a bridge?"" (Depends. What overpass?)  I kept thinking, ""if you're going to be homeless why not just take that money and get an apartment instead of paying off a stupid credit card."" Idiots.  She asked me if I was married I told her no, and she told me , ""i hope you get married and have to watch your husband die slowly in front of you.""  Good times.~~I work for a cell phone provider and this one customer called in to complain so much we weren't supposed to talk with her anymore, nor our supervisors nor managers. She gets transferred to the advocacy office every time.

One of the notes on her account said that she was upset that we would not give her another phone and told her she would either have to cancel her current contract (and pay the termination fees) and sign into a new contract, or find a used phone to put on her account. The reason she didn't have a phone anymore was because she sold it, and then wanted us to just provide her another one for free.~~People don't understand that being polite and clear with their questions and problems helps them get it solved faster. Like when I called about getting my phone sorted this morning. I had my shit in order, account number? here you go! name and date of birth? already done. your issue? My wife left me for the dog and but all I will tell you is that I just want to change plans. Installation fee? I am the one that needs to change plan so I will pay it. Done.

It sucks about the ones that jump up and down so much that eventually someone in the chain breaks and gives in.

You did good :)~~Regardless of who you have as a provider, at some point or another there will be negotiations. We don't want you to be without your programming either, trust me (for different reasons tho, we just don't want to hear about it).
We are currently going through it with a major childrens network, and it's amazing how sad and childish the networks are with their crawls. Then they demand credit, which we generally are allowed to give for this issue, but we get ear raped later by the sups who demand to know why are credit-per-call ratios are so high.~~I snapped once. It happens at times, and really, what you said really is not that bad at all. I'm out of the callcenter game nowadays, but my best tactic for people like that was to say, ""Sure I can certainly help by getting you in touch with the proper people for this! Please Hold!"", promptly putting them on hold and transferring them. Anyone around you from manglement will think you are a rockstar when they hear it!
~~Anytime a customer is rude or is taking out frustrations on me, the gal who just wants to help you out, I kill them with kindness. I put on that sickly sweet voice that just drips with contempt and go on with the call. They'll catch on pretty quick that you hate their guts and they could tell a manager, but what are they gonna say ""So-and-So was too nice."" It also really annoys the angry customers to no end, which is always a good feeling. ~~I hate those customers. The ones who think the fucking world revolves around them and set deadlines for things to be done.

Nope sorry, I do things as quickly as possible, I don't mess about or delay things just for fun you know? Unless you insist on holding me to a deadline, then you can guarantee I'll purposely do things slowly becouse you, Mr customer, are an entitled asshole ~~I absolutely refuse to give customer's guarantees.  I can't control things that are out of my hands.  
Customer: So can you guarantee a tech will be out tomorrow?  
Me: I have scheduled a tech for tomorrow between 1-3.  
No guarantee, just a statement of what I have done.  If the press me, I'll repeat myself until they realize I won't change my tune.  
Will a tech show up? Probably, but I can't guarantee it.~~Haha.

Reminds me of a call with DerpSat where a guy needed a service call. It was a Friday afternoon and first available technician was Sunday morning. He had called in multiple times trying to get an earlier date before I got him. He went on this rampage about how he called in and pretended to be a new customer and was told a new customer could be installed in 48 hrs, yet he, a ""loyal customer"", had to wait until Sunday. 

I had a legit argument over Sunday morning being within 48 hours. 

I'd like to think these people are in some anger induced fugue state that causes them to be so god damn stupid. At least that's what I tell myself to keep me from panicking, knowing there are so many fucking idiots in the world.~~I work from home, doing outbound calls. This isn't the only company I have ever worked from home with. Most companies make you have some kind of backup if the internet is down (i.e. an aircard or something).

I used to date a guy in IT and one of his clients who did trading from home had 3 different internet providers because he knew that if he lost internet, he would be out serious money. ~~I know I'm reading things into this that are based on personal experience on the tech support side of the call. I've got no issue getting rid of the guy. I just hope your tech support can do more than what I was able to. We couldn't sell anything and it seemed the main way we got similar calls was cold transfer. When we couldn't do anything for them, it inevitably ended up with an even more pissed off person. ~~Hahaha, I get service from your company, and saw that scroll bar just today. My first thought was, 'yeah, a cable company is going to say no to paying less, what unreasonable thing are you asking for in exchange for this price drop? Or what did you fuck up and are now offering a reduced price to make up for and are now panicking because said cable company told you to cram it with walnuts.' For real tho, what's the skinny, with the dispute?~~Wow. I guess I totally read that wrong.. 

It sounded to me like a little old black lady who was pissed that 'company employees' get a day of honoring Martin Luther King Jr. and they should get there to fix her problem so she could watch stories related to MLK day...

Now I need to reassess my whole life.. 

Do I always give vast benefits of the doubt like this?~~This is what I might have said in your shoes:

""You see, Ma'am, the potato isn't the whole fix, it just forces the device to connect for the 'authorization' it needs through your phone. But if you're not on the phone, or you're calling someone random, it won't be able to find us. Now that you are on our line, though, it will be able to find us if you try again.""~~The customer may still be in shock. When my mom died, it felt like saying it out loud made it more real, and I didnt want to admit that yet. Its still hard saying the word dead a year later. The customer might also have been dealing with shutting off services/getting single-user accounts changed all day/week/month and was frustrated. You dont realize how many things you need to take care of when someone dies. Having to explain over and over that yes, you know youre not authorized, but your loved one is dead takes a toll. And having to offer proof every time. Even though I was my moms only next of kin, I had to jump through hoops just to get what was left of her bank account.~~This is why I have zero interest in cable tv, generally.

I've tried to explain, multiple times, to the cable company here that they are an Internet Conduit to me. Nothing more. I don't want any other services. I will take care of doing IP versions of everything else, myself.

Last time I wanted 'cable TV' was for American Gods Season 1. I bought a Sling TV account and watched there, happily.

For Season 2, I ended up adding Starz to my Amazon Prime account for all of $9/month.~~I remember working the day that an extreme sports channel was taken off the air pending investigation. Our company was not a part of this and it was so sudden that they didn't tell the staff so when I got my first call about it I had to call through to the content team for the first time ever.

They looked it up and sure enough, it had been pulled pending investigation for regulatory breaches or something similar.

Back to the call to explain this to the angry customer who wants his money back because he only got this package for that one channel.

So when I suggest putting him over to the downgrades team to put him on the lower package he then freaks out because there are other channels he might want to watch on his current package.

I put a message out to help the other agents but I was the only one on my team getting these calls lol.~~I think my least favorite experience I have had with this is when VIACOM releases those commercials pretty much telling the subs to call in. One time a sub called in and had their child on the phone to try and guilt me into getting their channels back. Like what was I going to do? It was hard to reason with how I couldn't let him watch his favorite show. Best part was I would ask for his mom and she would keep saying in the background ""He has to talk to you so he knows he is breaking your heart"" or whatever. lol~~BTW I know nothing. I'm outbound and have had impolite people but nothing like yours.  A friend who is inbound had a call so horrific she was sent home with pay for the rest of the day. 

Even though I've heard I have it pretty easy, not sure how long I'll last.~~My favorite thing to do when I worked at a call center was to tell people I was putting them on hold and really putting them on mute. Loved hearing all the stuff they'd say when they thought I couldn't hear, which was mostly about the lies they were telling and what an idiot I was and how I would fall for them.~~When I did tech support for a company which made game controllers, I had a number of calls requesting help installing game port drivers for a certain operating system; when I told the customer that they should be calling that companys support line for help because it wasnt our sotware, Id be told that they had already called them and that was who had given them our number.

Rather than try to pass them back, Id help them install the driver and get them up and running.~~",The commenter shares a story about a customer who claimed she needed to do a settlement on her credit card because she had life insurance money from her husband dying.

13.0,"I usually resort to asking the customer how they propose the problem will be solved. They'll ask for a technician and I'll tell them sure, but they'll only come after you've done \[insert mundane check like plugging in power cord\] first, so if you go ahead and check that, we can send the technician. It usually ends with 'looks like that was the problem after all'.~~It isn't an entirely stupid question, if you consider there isn't enough information in it, since it depends on what she wants to do with it.

For example, say both 3 and 100 are download speeds, and she wants to send pictures. Since ISPs seperate upload and download, it is possible the 3mbit is upload and download, while the other 100mbit package may have only 1mbit upload, and so 3 would be bigger than 100 for her purpose.~~Is ask if she ever went to the grocery store and asked for her final bill to be half the price of what is owed. Would that really work every single time? Not likely. Maybe once under special circumstances? Maybe.

But to request that kinda shit for life? Who the hell do you.think you are?!~~when someone asks for something unreasonable just tell them of course (with a smile) and do what you normally do. they will assume you did as they wish and will probably never figure out you didn't.

if you had done this...she would have thought being placed in the cue was being placed at the head of the cue and would have never known the difference. she would have simply thought ""she won""...and that would have made her happy.~~I can actually sympathize with the guy who was getting the free channel, though. How could he know it was really free? Every time I've signed up for cable they've asked me if I wanted a ""free trial"" of one or several premium channels, every single time I've said NO, and every single time they give it to my anyway and I have to call and cancel before they start charging. If I was getting a channel I didn't pay for, I would assume I was about to have to pay for it somehow. Maybe a temporarily free trial, maybe accidentally signed up for the wrong package, whatever.

Maybe there was more about the call you didn't say, but it kinda sounded like the person coaching him was doing the right thing to help him manage his bills carefully.~~Worst part is when they think we can't see how long they watched it for. And due to policy we don't credit Adult content because, well, we can't be judgemental for how long it takes a guy to last lol. 

My favorite is when they try to claim someone must have broken into their house to watch it. ""Someone must have broken in and watched all those!"" 

Oh ok. Lemme go ahead and credit you back these 6 adult movies watched for 30 mins each starting from 1AM, and that Frozen movie you watched after before you went back on your 4 adult movies jack off spree shortly after. Yeah. That's exactly what a burglar would do. ~~You could be more explicit explaining to him: ""I'm sorry, because you are in an area which is transitioning from Small Cable Company(delta cable?) to Giant Asshole Cable(Shaw), they use different systems to look up and work on your account. On my screen I can neither see your account nor fix anything for you.""

By just saying you can't help him, he just thinks youre buck passing.~~One time I had an older lady on call who just wouldn't STFU and let me finish a sentence. We had a fire drill scheduled on that day. She went on frothing at the mouth and calling me incompetent, and then, would you believe it, it's the fire alarm. Just imagine my shit-eating grin as I was transferring her to one of the other two locations. :)~~I look down upon these people and their miserable lives, sometimes I even pity them if they start flaming; like ""aawwwkaaard"".

You do know you shouldn't take it personally right? You're just a voice which the company hires, the customer is objectifying the company as a person.  
  
The scripts and service is actually social engineering imo

~~I honestly have no patience for people like this. It's not because they're old. It's not because they're foreign. It's not because they're impatient. It's because they lack the ability to learn. That's what this life is about. If you chose not to learn about a technology that came out years ago, you probably don't deserve to use it now. If you can't learn to do something new, what the hell are you still doing here? ~~&gt; my wife has been suffering with the issues with our service.""

It's minor, but this pissed me off. People who lost their homes to natural disasters (like many in West Virginia) are suffering. Kids whose families are so poor that they don't get enough to eat are suffering. Not being able to watch Fox News because your Comcast (or whatever) service is hit or miss is not ""suffering"". Fuck him.~~I spent alot of time handling billing and tech support calls for US cable companies.

A woman called in to complain about her bill being so expensive. She barked at me that she only has ""basic"" cable. Yeah, no, you have HBO, Starz, over 100 channels. ""Basic"" cable would be like 12-15 local channels. 

And of course when I suggested to the customer they could always drop down to the basic package to save money, you'd think I was insulting them or something. Cue the inevitable rant about how they NEED these channels!!!!! Yeah, I don't miss those days.~~When people would pull the lawyer card this was my response. Well sir/madam thats your decision to take legal action, however you are going against lawyers who are on retainers for a multimillion dollar company.

And id usually get some shit response back or a manager response which Id say Unfortunately my managers are unavailable, they can call you back if you would like to repeat the information I provided you with Ive never gotten in trouble either the joys of maintaining the same vocal tone throughout a call. ~~Seriously. Any sane person would've just opened with that. Maybe he just assumed that he had to trick you; like people haven't ever died before and this scenario had never occurred.

I've had plenty of calls that open with ""I'm calling to let you know that my father has passed and as Executor of his estate I want to settle up the account (or) transfer it into my name.""~~I work in a tech support center, and do onboarding/offboarding for new bank users... I had this one field rep that would call me for help doing his job, and proceed to hit on me the entire call.  When I got engaged, he called, emailed, and IM'd multiple times to tell me how lucky I was, and how lonely he was.  Serious creeper.  I feel for you.  Good response, btw.~~"" all black people sit around thinking about killing white people all day "" Holy SHIT! What a whack job!  
I just figured it was more I don't want to get shot by a \* today! -if they happened to live in a bad neighborhood and that was the reality.~~Worked I for a government owned utility company. If we would have gotten that threat on a phone call, we had to send an email to a supervisor with the account. They then notified the local police department that there was a physical threat against an employee. They then send an officer to the persons house to speak to them.

Usually when that happens, the person quickly gets the point that threatening any government official is not a good idea. If we have to send a technician to their house, that technician has to have a police officer on scene for any work at the property. 

And as a government entity, ALL calls are recorded as a matter of public information.~~This reminds me of when my dad was looking at downgrading their internet to save money on the cable bill. There were like two internet options and they were already on the lowest, but they were subscribed to just about every channel package offered. He decided that there apparently just wasn't anywhere to trim the fat...~~Asking to be put to the front of the queue is obviously stupid, but the part about their bill not as much.

I was paying 34 for 200mb and it was going to go up to 37.25 from next month, I called up to cancel and they offered me 350mb for 33 a month. Im getting almost x2 my speed for less then I was paying and no price increase.~~Ah yes the I want a special treatment and I want it now! Call.  Classic and we just love them so much.  


I work at a utility company and I took a call from someone earlier yesterday where someone moved to another place and part of her bill that she had with us transferred to her new account.  She tried to dispute that the amount that carried over from her old account wasnt actually hers and someone else must have ran up her bill after she left and she didnt want to pay it.  But there were notes on that old account stating she had multiple conversations with us after she claimed she moved out.   Like sorry, no we cannot wipe off what you owe us just because you move.~~Sometimes when we get so much into the routine of things we can give information quickly. Because we are used to saying what we do. But if the person who is calling for help asks to slow down. That's when you speak clearer and slower. Not keep on going too fast.
Sometimes a reminder that not everyone knows what might be said going quickly is a good thing.~~I work at a call center that gets inbound calls from other call centers. 

I feel your pain. I have to constantly tell these folks to slow down and speak clearly. 

Oh and ask a yes no question?  and you WILL get a response that takes 10 minutes to unwind.~~","The commenter suggests asking the customer how they propose the problem will be solved, as it depends on what the customer wants to do with it.

14.0,"I worked in a call centre, one night a woman called to find out why her TV service wasnt working.

Me: it says here that youre deceased.

Her: WHAT?!?

Her name was something like Carol Jackson. I looked deeper. Someone had mailed in a death certificate for a Carol Jackson, but didnt include an account number or other identifying details. There were 5 customers named Carol Jackson. So the agent that opened that piece of mail GUESSED which Carol Jackson died, and disconnected the wrong account.

I asked some authenticating questions, then apologized profusely and reconnected her services.

Her: you know ... I believe in signs ... this is really disturbing to me .... I wonder what it means ....

Me: again maam, I am REALLY SORRY.

And I notified a supervisor, so that some could start calling the other Carol Jacksons to check in...~~Working in a government call centre. Very restricted. Highly sensitivity info. Lots of security hoops to jump through. 

Call came through from a female voice, male voice in the background was giving all the answers to the security questions (their phone was on speaker). Absolutely no doubts it was his account, but she tried to claim it as her own. Literally all it would have taken was for him to give me permission to speak to her on the call, and i would have done it. Some people think they are too clever for you to catch them out.~~It sounds like you spoke to my mother. She would try to get copies of my medical record to see if I was going to the doctor when I said I was and what the doctor said/talked about with me. For refence I am 32 years old.  I have to black list my mother at my doctors office. She tried to get into the same office and they told her they won't accept her as a patient.~~I laughed on a call once when someone threatened to revoke his $100/year membership because I refused to refund him the money to a show he bought tickets for. He called 10 hours before the show began, sounding perfectly healthy, claiming to have the flu and won't be able to make it so he would like a refund. 

We had a 48 hour policy for exchanges and absolutely no refunds since we're non-profit and the money technically isn't all ours. 

He got beligerent and screamed at me, called me a bitchy idiot and told me he was gonna get me fired for not treating him right. I laughed in his ear. Told him that because he used profanity, I wil lm be hanging up now and slammed the end call button.~~it blows my mind the sheer number of people i talk to over the phone that just dont seem to understand how being an adult works. yeah, i get it, youre busy. welcome to adulthood. we're all busy. most of us can pay our bills on time just fine, i dont understand why you seem to think that does not apply to you. CLEARLY you should not have taken out a car loan if you dont understand the basic concept of a ""due date"". some people man. at least it makes for entertaining stories XD~~I had a company that did the same thing.  We only did auto loans and rentals/leases and medical claims.    The people that would swear at us and threaten to come kick our ass and kill us would often call back incredulous when their was gone in the morning.  

""How DARE you take my car.""   It's not yours until you pay for it, and you TOLD me you weren't going to pay for it.

""Do you know the difference between me and you""?  (they were trying to make a point that they had more class and scruples than we did) but my answer was, 'Yeah, I have a ride to and from work today'.~~\&gt;  L: ""Oh, no that's me I'm her mother.""  


""Oh I'm sorry, since you've said you're two people now I can no longer confirm you're the owner of the payment source being used nor can I release information as you are not the debtor. Anything else I can help you with?""   


This how we deal with those where I work. Pretty fun. Play stupid games win a stupid price.~~Ugh I hate people like that. Your bill is not my responsibility. You are in charge of making sure they get paid and you are getting statements every month. I can guarantee she is going to call back pissed when her account closes. I get this alot with autopay. People call in yelling about how it's our fault we didn't take the payment even though their card expired or they had to cancel it and act like my company with over 80 million customers is going to keep track of why your payment didn't go through. And FYI yes I can see when we've sent texts or emails about a bill or if your mail is getting scanned at its destination.~~I wish there was a way of restricting who can comment here. So many people bragging about the way they harassed people just trying to do their jobs, rather than asking how to solve the problem in a manner that is legal and that respects the employees trying to protect customers privacy.

A few here, but they pop up on many posts.~~My friends mother is a drama queen and is insufferable.  Someone rang her, she wouldn't say who and she obviously did the tears and threatened suicide and next thing, the Police were at the door.  She apparently got really shitty with the police when they initially turned up and she wouldn't let them in so they told her on the doorstep why they were there with the neighbours listening (which is why we all found out).  I bet she'll be nicer in future, possibly, well probably not but I bet she'll never threaten suicide again! ~~I used to work in debt settlement and we had a client that coincidentally had the same married name as her mother in law, who had passed. It took months to clear up that she is in fact 40 years younger and very much alive. All this poor lady wanted was to get her finances in order!~~Loved this, sounds like he doesnt usually miss payments and feels bad about it. If Ive missed a payment Ill start the call by acknowledging Im an idiot and asking if the advisor can help me to sort this out. Funnily enough, being nice to the agent and accepting responsibility for my own error tends to get me what I want or need.~~god i WISH i could say that to those that ask for the delinquency to be removed from their cbr.

i had a lady call me twice to have it removed because she was buying a house. then a collections rep called us, and got me, to ask if it was possible. i told him ""i already told her twice we cannot remove the delinquency, so she should know.""

god. and the other time a guy demanded i do a cbr dispute, but he said on a recorded line he knew he missed his payment and knew the account was over 30 days past due.~~These situations are so frustrating! I had a similar one the other day, a customer wanted information that we didnt have, so I was *trying* to tell him who he actually needed to contact to get the info but he wouldnt listen.. he got so annoyed he hung up shouting he was going to call straight back so he could speak to someone who knew what they were doing. He did call back, but immediately came straight back through to me; he was not best pleased at all!!~~I know of one guy who took out a loan against his car and failed to keep up with the repayments so had the bailiffs turn up to seize it, at which point he smashed the car's windows, among other things, telling the bailffs to ""fucking take it now"". Problem is, the car belonged to the loan company until the entire loan was pais off, so he was arrested and charged with criminal damage.

All he did was go from being a guy with no car to being a guy with no car and a criminal record~~I have had sooooooooooo many loans where I never knew the terms until MONTHS after that stuff is due. Contracts didnt specify that stuff. No, I didnt receive a bill. No, no one called or wrote or emailed me to let me know the payment was due. Yes, Im old. But shot, I bought something on terms and havent received a bill for nearly 45 days?  Im calling someone somewhere to find out who I need to pay and when.  Take responsibility. Why is this such a foreign concept?????~~Tbh if someone called me and refused to tell me what it was about I would do the same thing. Nothing against you, youre just doing your job of course! But I wouldnt want to give my name if I didnt know what the call was about. And I dont even have debt!~~Funny story: Guy walks in on a Wednesday asking if he can pay for a hitch installation with a check. My boss IMMEDIATELY says no, i say no, everyone says no. I ask why she was so quick on the trigger, she tells me this guys checks have been bouncing for 3 months. He and his wife come in 2 days later for their appointment, i install the hitch in record time (under 2.5 hrs including wiring), and this lady shows the fuck up to the desk, whips out her checkbook and tells me ""I call and dey say i can pay wit check! How you propose we fix dis?""

Ended up calling my boss cuz they bounced 2 credit cards and a debit, ended up having to rip the whole goddamn thing off the car, wiring and all.~~I had so many people call in when I worked for Direct Provider of Satellite Television saying, I was in the hospital all last month so I didnt get to use my services. I should get this bill free. And then when you check their services there are like 10 porn orders from the last two weeks.~~To be honest, I would coach one of my employees in an instant if they said ""Oh, okay"" to a caller informing of a death. It literally takes 2 seconds to extend condolences and is irrelevant to whether the client's request will be accepted. If you have a psychology degree then you should recognize the human-level impact it makes to have someone simply acknowledge your troubles, even if they cannot help.~~I worked in Loss Mit for a long time for a Fortune 500 company. Id always try to be patient because people were facing foreclosure, but sometimes people would just call to yell at someone. Id spend a long time trying to get someone into a feasible plan only to have them go HAHA I WASTED YOUR TIME LIKE YOU WASTED MINE

14.0,"I used to work in a call center that took bets over the phone on horse and dog races. We routinely got people threatening to kill us if their means to deposit funds was declined, they lost their bets, they didnt get a bet in place in time, etc. I got a death threat of some form or other every few months.

From time to time people would threaten self harm, but that was comparatively rare. And they never sounded serious, just desperate to get money for more bets.

We had very carefully kept our location a secret and never gave out the address. So we mostly ignored the death threats and tried to sympathize a little with the suicide threats.~~Good God. These people are something else. My grandmother was born in 1932. For as long as I can remember, she would include me in my medical bills and tell me what I needed to do, and what they expected, and pretty much everything she knew about it. At the age of 18, she handed me all of my info and told me I had to make appointments, and take care of everything because they won't talk to her anymore. The most she's done since then (I'm 41), is say, ""did you get that bill paid? Do you need some money?""


I feel so sorry for these people whose parents can't let go, and try to shove their nose in their adult child's business. I really wish I could do something. Everyone deserves their own life and privacy.~~My spouse had something weird where the autopay started going to the wrong account. It was always paid over the amount due and close to being paid off and we got notice that it hadnt been paid in 3 months. Not exactly sure what happened, but it was corrected with a ton of apologies and come to find out, it was actually paid off. When they were ready to repossess it. Weirdest thing.

We dont know if a computer system was updated or if something was reinput wrong or if there was some fraud. They credited back all the interest charged and paid us back the overpayment. It was also back when you had payment books with little tickets to mail in, but we just noted the transaction dates from the account.~~Ok look, if you borrow a twenty from your friend to go get a pizza, and then you don't like the pizza, are you going to bug your friend to talk to the pizza place about it? He didn't have anything to do with the pizza, he just lent you the twenty, right?~~Someone should have told that to my mother. She works at the undergraduate school I went to. At the time she worked in a position that she could just pull up grades and stuff for students if she wanted to (but wasn't supposed to if there wasn't a work related reason). A position where she regularly took call just like these!!! She said I'd get in trouble if i didn't tell her my grades, and that she'd look them up herself.
I should have reported her, and I still regret not doing so.
Later that same year she tried pulling the same stunt with my credit card.
And she wonders why I don't trust her, or tell her anything~~I once had a caller who raved, ranted, hurled profanity-laden abuse and personally blamed me because she couldnt get a mortgage due to an old debt with our organisation.  She thought that since wed stopped pursuing the debt that it had magically evaporated. 

I never knew that I had the power to go back in time and make her ignore the reminders shed been sent before Id ever worked in the company.~~She hasn't paid in months if her account is about to be closed and she waits that long to call to tell you she hasn't received any statements? Nevermind the fact that if she really worked at a bank, she'd know the payment is due whether she gets the statement or not~~Ah, collections is a very interesting beast. People dont understand how I could have worked in it.

It was actually simple. We provided TV service. We asked to be paid for the TV service. We were not paid for the TV service. Therefore we applied late fees and eventually took away the TV service.

When I stripped the role down to the basics, it was easy to let the screams and threats roll over me.~~&gt; I will be reporting your company to the Better Business Bureau 

Whenever customers tell me this, I always want to tel them "" You are free to report to them, but they are essentially just Yelp before yelp and all they will do is see what if we did everything within the policy.""~~One thing I despise more than almost anything else are helicopter parents. I get those all the time when the kid comes in for an oil change and mommy or daddy call in bitching about the invoice. If it's not their name on the invoice, I can't discuss it with them. Period.~~To be fair, the number of sales calls we get at our work where they refuse to say anything about who they are or why they are calling unless they are speaking to the target of the call is annoying and for the most part we just refuse the call if they will not provide some basic information.~~Yeah, I've gotten a few of these over the years.  Often I just read back their address and phone number, then remind them that these calls are, in fact, recorded.  Then I ask if he is really certain that he wants to be committing a felony by uttering threats...  They usually back down.  When they don't we note the account and inform the police.  

The RCMP take a very dim view of people offering bodily harm to others at their place of work.~~LOL.  I used to work in mortgage servicing and this type of call came up a lot there too.  The wife gets the house, but can't qualify on her own to remove the ex by refinancing or assuming the loan.  The only suggestion we could make is for her to sell the house altogether.  But for some reason, people think a court order between two individuals somehow forces third party corporations to do.. something.  Sorry but no.~~Name isnt on the account? I cant even acknowledge that the account exists. You have POA? Youre the parent/spouse/child/rando taking care of their business? Great. Get them to put your name on their account (or give permission) and Ill talk to you about it... if there is one. Otherwise, fuck off. No, invoking the name of your deity/congressperson/attorney isnt going to help. Privacy laws are there to protect everyone all of the time and not just when its convenient for you.~~This is tangently related. I am an office manager at a church across the street from a university. Every September I have at least one mother call and tell me we need to go escort their princess to the church service because she is too afraid to walk around on her own. Mom, shes now an adult and she is choosing NOT to go to church. Probably because you forced it on her up until now. We are RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. If she wants to look us up, she will. 
Sorry, probably not related but irks me every time.~~Ahaha feelsgoodman.jpeg.

I had something similar today, about not making their bill in time and paying for late fees or something, but I quickly glossed over it by saying well actually I wouldnt, however my personal opinion is irrelevant to the situation at hand. What we could do is...

Dont belittle and berate someone and then expect them to agree with your opinion, you entitled narcissistic cunt! 

(I might be dragging that around with me  )~~I volunteered at a community help centre where we helped with everything. Lost your job. Well help you look for another one and apply for any benefits you qualify for. Anti social neighbours we know jsut who to put you in touch with to get things sorted. 

Out of 20 regulars who worked there only 3 where paid staff. Yet we constantly when we couldn't snap out fingers to fix their problems would be called all the names under the sun. Be told we hadn't earnt our wage that day. 

My personal fav my tax money pays your wage. No it doesn't. I didnt get paid for doing it and none of the funding came from any form of government. If our fundraisers didnt earn enough we couldn't make rent~~I understand the need to keep information private. What I don't get is when I say I don't want details, I'm holding the paper invoice in my hand and I just want to pay it and then get an argument. 
I already know who that bill is addressed to, what th account number is and how much the total is. 
Just let me pay it.~~If I get a call for either myself or someone else, I always ask the following:

Whom (exactly) are you trying to reach?

What company are you with?

What is a good callback number?

Without this information:

 I do not, will not, and cannot confirm any information

 I will not relay information

 I will not speak with you further

There are just too many scammers using social engineering to rip you off.~~I will never understand this way of living.. Did I want a nice car? Yes! Did I buy one? Oh hell no! That thing is from the 90s, scratched on all sides and is something I would feel ashamed to see my grandma drive in. But hey, you know what? I was able to afford it without a single loan and with a reasonable emergency fund left in my bank account. 

Do not buy shit on loans unless it's a house or something. It's a terrible investment and when it breaks and you're still paying for it you'll feel like a triple idiot.

I'll always be surprised about the American credit card system. In Europe if you even have one debt no way hose you're getting a loan for a house. Upside down world and we're not even in Australia yet.~~I can't count how many times customers threatened to sue me or the company where I worked, and usually it was for piddly little things.  I would reply with something like, ""Well, you're within your rights to do just that.  What's your attorney's name so we'll know who it is when he or she contacts us?""  Threw them all off their game.

We never got sued.~~I had a friend who had taken over a call (we were both supervisors at that time), in which the customer was throwing a backhanded fit because we turned off his satellite service, screaming about how hed never received a first notice. My friend very calmly stated, Sir, your bill WAS your first notice. I about fell out of my chair laughing!~~I too had it a few times over the years, but once I had guy insisting to get the address of the call center so he could come down with his chainsaw and cut us all in pieces.  Needless to say I disconnected the call and forwarded the account to our director, who suspended the customer's service (I work for a telephone company) and called the authorities.~~","The commenter used to work in a call center that took bets on horse and dog races and received death threats from people who were desperate to get money for more bets.

14.0,"I work tech support, and what I wouldn't give to be able to cancel accounts when I have to deal with that kind of BS instead of transferring to our retention department.  At least 75% of customers will drop the call during the transfer, usually in the first 10 seconds, so you know it was just a ploy on their part to try and get you to do what they want.  Even worse, I'm a ""supervisor"" so I'm at least the second person to tell them we cant do what they want.~~So both of my parents died by the time I was 30. I remember after my mom died I went insane and everything fell to shit around me. I was speaking to someone at a call center and told them my mom had died. They said nothing at all. It hurt more than it ever should have and I still remember the feeling to this day. Grief is isolating and horrible and sometimes the reaction is to go around telling everyone so that for a minute you can get an im so sorry or some sort of acknowledgment. It seems stupid but it helps to have your pain recognized. I dont have a degree in psychology but I understand that very basic need. When I ended up in a call center I put up with a ton of shit but if someone was grieving I always acknowledged it. Its hard shit. In this case I think you could learn something from this interaction and do better next time.~~I've got a colleague in higher ed who deals with this a few times a year. From the helicoptery (parents trying to get their college-aged adult's grades bumped up) to the holy shitty (asking for their adult child's address and school accounts statements). But the worst thing is it sometimes happens in person, where they just pop in to her office. ~~I used to work for a company similar to Groupon. We provided discount vouchers for specific products and my main role was to help people redeem their codes. Probably every other customer who called me called with the intention to get a bigger discount. Every day was the same. They would give me an excuse (single mother, disabled child, terminal illness etc.) and I would have to explain to them that I was sorry but I had no control over the amount of the voucher. I could only guide them through the redemption process or issue them a new code if the voucher didnt work. Then I would be called a heartless piece of shit. So I rarely have any sympathy for a stranger over the phone.~~When I worked in auto collections, we had a customer who was three months behind on his loan and called us in a panic because he saw a tow truck drive down the street and figured it was for him. (Which it was...)  Customer decided right then to pay in full over the phone.  Great.  This called off the repo notice.  Until three days later when the payment didn't clear  (lack of funds or stopped payment, I don't recall now which it was).  When the repossession went on as planned, he was angry because ""I paid in full!""  Um, no.~~honestly people can be like this allll the time and it's exhausting. i'm in a bank setting so i actually refer to programs like yours all the time because i KNOW the DMP program will help them (or hopefully you'll tell them to file for bankruptcy if it's that bad) but people get so nasty or petulant or demanding if I suggest they use DMP. it's like ""....you have 43k in revolving credit card debts OUTSIDE of this bank. maybe....this is a good solution....""~~Schools go through this the second the little precious one turns 18. All of a sudden parents can't even ask if their kid attended school that day.

On the other hand, my sister changed therapists when she learned she couldn't sit in on her 13 year old son's therapy. She wanted all the details so she could 'help the therapist fix him'. I would say it was funny but it was truly sad for my nephew.~~The guy sitting next to me in our call centre just had this;

E(the guy): hello your through to bleep my name is bleep how can I help you?

C(caller): I waited an hour to get through to you and I was hung up on your service is disgusting. I have had to wait another hour now to get you again.

E: I am so sorry that happened can I take your details now and we can look to resolve this for?

C: No I don't want to discuss it any further. 

Click phone down. You waited an hour to get back through to tell us you were unhappy you were hung up on. To give us no details to report this or fix your problem! A full hour.~~I mean I get life happens but at some point you need to make arrangements for your debt or accept the consequences of not paying it... whether or not you can afford it our companies still expect you to honour the contract you signed, lady. Why dont customers get thattttt~~I work at an health insurance call center, we get those every once in a while. You always have to take them seriously. And personally, I have mental health issues and if they are saying it as either a joke or in an attempt to get sympathy or obtain something (change benefits or claims) then I don't feel bad about calling the police for a welfare check.

There's always that chance it's real, and if they're not serious hopefully they learn not to make these threats in the future.

Story, we had a woman call back the day after she threatened suicide and complain. She said that we had violated hipaa by giving out her address to police for a welfare check. So I guess we should have assumed she was joking and left her alone or just have let her harm herself?? I don't know what came of her accusation, but I don't believe it was a violation of hipaa as far as I know. ~~I could never understand the ""I will go to the papers"" thread.

I mean, sure the papers will be totally interested in your story of how you could not refund an opened package of food because you did not like the taste. Let's put it on the front page! 

The only better one is ""I will call the cops""... Because we are unwilling to give you loyalty points for a purchase you have no receipt for, but ""remember exactly"" (unless I ask what items you purchased, because you only ""exactly"" remember how much money you spent). I am sure the cops will be super interested in your loss of... 80 cents?~~So you bullied a young girl new at her job with inside information. Good for you. 

''Hey Mr. Awesome''

Lol ok mate. Sorry to break this to you, but you're not. You're not awesome.

''I hung up and busted out laughing, I mind fucked that poor girl so badly.''

Your kudos is meaningless, you obviously enjoyed making her feel bad on the call and putting yourself above her temporarily. Sad stuff.~~I had a customer call in and when I asked for their name they gave me the male name on the account, so I called them sir and they got mad because it was the wife of the account holder. Well why did you give me your husband's name when I asked for your name?~~The first car I bought I had autopay set up and never really thought about the payments.  Had some fraud on my account and had to change all my account information and moved all around the same time.  Totally forgot about the autopay on the car, and because of forwarding mail wasn't getting to me in a timely manner.  Finally got a call from the bank about having 2 missed payments.  I freaked out and started looking into it and figuring out how to get everything up to date, when they told me that I literally only had 2 more payments to make before it was paid off.  Needless to say, I made those payments immediately.~~The phrase that gets me all the time is when a customer claims ""I never agreed to that!"". When it comes to like a subscription or something like that.

Especially those who pay for a year up front and then it comes up for a renewal. I get it, it is easy to forget things, BUT at least leave a bit of room for error on your part. The problem seems to be that , they DID agree to the contract or whatever it is call, but they didn't READ the terms and conditions.~~It is frustrating as someone who sounds the opposite gender on the phone, to go through all security checks and still have he phone agent refuse the call.

What in the living forest is someone supposed to do when they have an unusual voice?

If I am calling from the number on file, have in my hand the most recent papers mailed to the address on file, and can verify every bit of data on the account (name, address, government ID numbers (state and federal), all transactions on the account by date and amount, previous call dates and times, etc etc etc   
What am I meant to do then?

This has been an issue my entire adult life (and must also be a recurring issue for gender-nonconforming people as well).

Separately, I have managed a call center, and worked in several (including billing).

Im just seeking suggestions from other peoples experiences.~~Not call center but ticket support.
We have a special team which we forward such threats to and they try to figure out what police to contact together with ISPs and such.

We offer services world wide so it is sometimes harder to do, but it is important.

I have to do this at least once a month next to several real life threats, like doing harm to others and even terrorist attack threats.
(I remember a teen was basically swatted through us, because he threatened to bomb an office with really specific info and dates. All I heard back, was that he is a teen and that it will get expensive for his family)~~I work in collections also and (without being there to listen to the call) this kinda seems like it was made confusing on everyones part.

The spiel a lot of people in our call centre use is normally something like the payment youve made today will prevent the account being liable for debt escalation(repossession), but as its still behind you would either need to bring the account fully up to date or set some form of payment arrangement with us.

We also are encouraged to promote payment solutions before payments are made so that any payments they want to make on that call will count towards their first payment of any arrangement, though I understand that doesnt necessarily work with the stubborn ones.~~I work in a medical call center and I get this ALL THE TIME. No lady, I cant give you access to your 20 year old kids medical records because they havent said we can. No, I cant tell you what the scheduled appointment is for. No, I cant give you the information that you want cause theres federal laws prohibiting it. Sorry youre pissed off, nothing I can do about it.

&gt;So, with the understanding that this call is being recorded, you opened a letter addressed to an adult that is not yourself?   Congratulations!  You just admitted to a Federal offense!~~Comments here are interesting to me. When I worked for a large phone company in the U.K. we were allowed to take a payment over the phone from anybody for any account.

The caller did not have to be verified because we did not need to tell them any information from the account to take a payment from them.

How did they know how much to pay? Well, often they had the account holders bill in front of them or the account holder had told them what payment was required. All they had to say was I want to pay XX amount into account number XXX. If they didnt know how much was owing we could not reveal any figures from the account. The caller could just decide on a figure they wanted to pay that they guessed might cover the amount their relative or friend owed. Some people did that.~~The Im too old to use a computer excuse gets less and less believable with each passing year. Shes in her 50s? That means she was under 30 years old in the 90s. By that time almost everyone that age was using computers at work or at home and the internet was becoming a thing in the general population.

For the record, Im 62. I code and teach coding and other computer-related skills. My dad is 90 and he uses his iMac heavily (not expertly, but pretty well). Theres no excuse.~~They understand.  I dont get calls from bill collectors but I do get a signifigant number of telemarketing calls claiming to be personal business too.  Most of those are to try buy my house which is not for sale.  Two were surveys lately.  Totally frustrating for a bill collector yes because yours is a legitimate call.  But the telemarketers might be the reason.~~We give help with things like food for people who are in the shit and haven't had their payments for whatever reason. A lot of people apply when they are getting their payments which means we can't help, but we have to respond to every applicant. Naturally, dealing with desperate people means sometimes when saying no they get abusive or make threats of harm against themselves. I've never had someone I thought was genuinely going to harm themselves but if they make a threat, we have to report it. Every time I have the police have got back in touch to let us know the person is fine.

There's been plenty of people who haven't made any kind of threat who I've been far more concerned about but unless they outright say something it's impossible to do anything about it.~~What do you mean you can't just press a red button and magically make everything go my way!?!?!??! I'M THE CUSTOMER!!! I'M ALWAYS RIGHT!!!   

I hate that I typed that out. I work in a healthcare org call center. They think we can do this about their medications or what not.    

Between this and retail it has just made me hate the general public even more.~~Honestly the best thing you can do with that type debt is just dispute it and say you dont recognize it. You can hire a credit fixing company for like 50$ that will just spam the collection agency until they remove it. Even if you pay the debt it won't remove the negative mark, so whether you pay or not is the same, but if the company can't sufficiently prove the debt or answer the request to do so in time, it will be removed. It's a dirty secret that collection companies don't want you to know.~~I've noticed that most of the ones who are truly in dire situations aren't the ones calling to tell you their sob stories. They've got other things on their minds so they pay just enough to keep from getting hounded by us. 


The ones who make a stink are almost always talking out of their asses. ~~I work for a nonprofit that helps people pay their energy bills, because of covid the state hasn't let the electric companies disconnect anyone since November of last year. While this is good because if families fall behind because of job loss they have until May 2021 to catch up, I have people calling angry we won't cover their entire debt because they didn't have to pay so just didn't. For over a year. There are people who think we should pay a $3000, sometimes $5000 balance on their electric. I get cussed out on the daily, its exhausting.~~Ungrateful customers ae the worst. If you are are jerk the whole time, then I don't feel for ya' at all, but don't put on a nice song and dance and then do a complete 180 for me. I have had a couple instances where I have gone to bat for the customer because of how pleasant and how what seemed to be the earnest struggle o the situation was. 

Their response? ""Is that all you can do"" Karen, is that all I can do, is that all I can do??!?!?! Let me check, short of literally kissing your ass, yeah, that is what I can do, which is above and beyond what anyone else here would be able to do. Too many people view kindness as weakness.~~Lmao. On top of what everyone else said about you being a horrid person, no 8% APR is NOT a steal. And they may waive the late fee but it could still affect your credit rating. Did you seriously take a card to build a credit rating then fuck that up to play a ridiculous prank on someone just doing their job? Were you dropped on the head as a baby? Are you trolling? This entire post is just wtf.~~I've had those, almost always a  family member that's the culprit, if they're not just straight up lying of course. They obviously think it's ridiculous to report fraud to the police, yet expect us to take legal threats seriously. The most gratifying part is I get to end those interactions with ""would you like to make a payment?"" lol~~Lololol.

Reminds me of doing collections a few years ago I had one for a hospital, rang up and asked for a normal guys name and a woman answered.

She went off hardcore, because the name was her Newborns name and she though I was some crazed pedophile.

I guess the hospital just fucked up and put the kids name on the bill instead of the parents/ I tried to explain, but she just hung up. Oh well. Back onto the dallier. ~~I had a caller from a bulk residential area (they don't pay us directly) about how she had no more cable since the area is now digital and the area needs a set top box to watch tv. Shes hysterical that she cannot watch any tv and starts mentioning suicide while taking a bunch of pills and listening to classical music. Had my leads contact the police and they took forever to get to her place. 

I didnt tell her I was sending police but she straight up lied to them when they knocked on her door. I talked to the main officer about what she had mentioned and what she said, and explained the situation that its past 9pm and there is absolutely no way in hell we can get anyone out there to install a cable box for her. Plus she needs to speak to the bulk department to even have that kind of thing setup, which I am not bulk support.~~I'm concerned about your company's policy that you can't call the police on night shifts. I assume in this case you could tell it wasn't a serious threat but in a situation where you genuinely believe someone might hurt themselves that's dangerous to them, your mental health, and the whole company legally. Being in a mental health related situation where you don't know whether to escalate is stressful, and your company needs an unambiguous policy to protect everyone. Even if they just have a dedicated supervisor on call for these situations to call the police. I'm surprised this doesn't come up enough in a debt collection agency for there to already be a policy on it.~~Good for you in actually standing up to this sort of thing.  Some companies do act like it is insane to expect these invasions of privacy, but I'd say about half the companies I have dealt with are perfectly fine with it, unfortunately.  I've also seen hospitals give family info to other family members that the patient didn't want shared (usually to their parents or husband), at 19 my college allowed a parent to change my class schedule that I had registered for, and my brother has been locked out of his own insurance and bank account multiple times.  I had a lot of trouble closing a stock market account that had been opened in my name when I was a minor - they noticed when I turned 18 to start sending me tax info, but refused to let me sell or close the account.  It took me until I was about 25 to completely get everything closed out with them and stop them from reopening the account or sending things to my parents.~~I didnt realise just how difficult call centre staff have it on a daily basis. This only occurred to me the other day when I had a spontaneous epiphany moment. 

I only ever call customer services when something is wrong. That almost always results in annoyed/irritated/angry people hurling their problems at you. 

Kudos to all of you.~~Yeah, I would have shut that shit down way earlier, lol. Ive had to work a lot on not explaining *why* to customers (and coworkers tbh) and just doing what needs to be done, but that would also be me wanting to peace out of the call in general. Maam! I would like to take care of this for you. I just need your permission to send the necessary email.~~I personally enjoy that you pulled out your own bill just to make an ass of her. She's hopeless. 


I created an online account with my company's rewards program so I could see how ridiculous they were when I navigate them on where ""forgot my password"" is...which is directly under the login button since they can't seem to put in the correct password~~The planet is full of idiots and their birth rate is very high. Don't sweat it, next call. Don't waste time on people not worth it, on the phones and also in your personnal life. At least when you get them on the phone, you get paid for it and if it wasn't for them you'd be out of a job.~~I fucking hate people who make excuses like this. Most of the time you can tell theyre lying, and even if the ARE telling the truth, that doesnt entitle them to free service, or whatever thing theyre avoiding paying for. Also, I hear the sick kid excuse about 20 times a day. After a while you just dont care anymore. Fuck you, pay me.~~&gt;someone is a decent human, I'll do everything I can, if you're a total ass...well you're use to shit, aren't you?

Its amazing how so many people who call into call centers dont understand that.  If someone is nasty to me, I just want them off my damn phone.  Ill do what my job requires, but I wont do anything special for them.  If they are nice and want a favor, I will literally do everything in my power to get it done.~~","The commenter explains that when they worked for a large phone company in the UK, they were allowed to take payments over the phone from anyone for any account, even if they didn't know how much to pay. They also mention that people who are too old to use computers often don't"
14.0,"I had notated it pretty well, I also got my sup to keep an eye on the account for when they called back in so he could take the call for the next agent if needed. Honestly though 90% of the customers we got were aggressive assholes so it wasnt too out of the norm lmao.~~I work for a financial institution and can 100% confirm they dont want to send you to collections, nor repossess (if secured loan)  something. We will work our damnedest to not take your car/house back for non payment. It costs us money and time to chase it down and we never get whats owed back.~~I worked in a bank call centre where people would call in and impersonate their kids or whatever to access their banks. If we had a funny feeling we could put the call on hold and have it checked but it never needed to get that far. The fucking SECOND someone passes verification on an account that's not theirs, they're just compelled to either tell you they're not them, or start making it super obvious.

9/10 times if you just ask someone, ""are you the owner of this account"" they'd just say no.~~i had sort of a negative experience in this situation, i'm trans and the representative would not believe i was the account holder because my legal name doesn't match my voice. it was infuriating, i had to beg them to ask me some questions or something to verify my identity, they just wanted to hang up on me!~~I had a similar situation. Lady calls in upset. Wants to cancel. Since she was in the first 30 days, we can just cancel it as it the beginning to process a full refund. Its like a review period. I tried explaining this about three times but they insisted to just cancel it as of today. Tried to rephrase it multiple times but I have to cancel it when they ask me too. So no refund for you.~~Called a customer back to do a follow up.  The info we had in the system listed the business as a NY Law Firm.  Called into their IT Department, and the voice mail message was for a pizza joint.  Thinking that I had miss dialed, I tried again with the same results.  So I listed the number as bad and closed the case.  Three days later the company called in wanting to know why the case was closed and the call came to me.  I told them about the pizza thing and they said ""oh, we do that to keep the telemarketers out.""  Then they wanted free crap because we never called them.~~Ha ha I love it when you put these assholes on the spot and they have no choice but to eat crow!

Question: How does one run up a $1500 electric bill? My city electric will cut your shit if you are 45 days late. Go 46 days over? Your shit is gone. Your company must be more lenient. ~~nice! It be even more fun if you didn't have a specialized complaints department though. I haven't had that exact situation but I've told people no and they ask to be transferred to such a department an I get to say there is no such thing but I will take their official complaint and no, you still can't get what you want. Anything else? ~~So I am a Caseworker with senior citizens.  I had one who called me all mad at his ISP. He said he was on the phone with a girl and did cry at one point.  He told me the sheriff's knocked on his door at 1 am and he wanted to report the isp.  I asked if he mentioned they wanted him dead like he says to me at least once a month?  He gets all quiet and said well I told them they had the gun to my head you may as well pull the trigger.  I was like we'll there you go buddy there are the consequences I always warn you about.  ~~Ugh, I have a lot of payment cases where I work, and sometimes people go to debt collection. We refer them to the debt collection company but it's horrible listening to them begging me to do this and that with their invoice. I can't imagine working for a debt collection company. I work for a fashion company and it's always adults who are shopaholics and can't manage their finances. It can be heartbreaking to hear but sometimes it's obvious a lot of them are just extremely irresponsible with their finances.~~Wow he sounds absolutely delightful. I hope you have a mechanism to pass that account to collections so someone can take formal action against his entitled ass to get the money he owes your company.

Also you have the patience of a saint to withstand that torrent of abuse! Id have hung up after the first round.~~I dont know how many times Ive used the same phrase about signing a contract for payments for xx amount on xx day every month. 

I worked in insurance premium financing so we would contact the insurance company to request cancellation of the policy. We also sent notice their local insurance agencies. People would say they never got a bill in the mail and I would tell them we send that out as a courtesy.~~My Mother used an organization like yours a long time ago. She had credit card debt and huge medical bills. The organization worked with the cc vendors to drop the interest and let her pay x per month which she did religiously. The doctors/hospitals didnt charge interest but set up pay monthly plans. It was great!! She wrote 1 check per month to the organization and they dispersed it to whom it was owed.

It helped her get completely out of debt.~~I had a woman on Saturday who's account was written off. She tried to pay it off at the start of the loan two years ago, was told she was $115 short, hung up on our agent, and never paid again. So all the interest is now due.

She told me she would pay the $115 now to close out the account. You're a titch late with that offer, ma'am.~~My mother would go on benders growing up and just not adult, so Id have to get on the phone and pay the bills quite frequently. I always just pretended to be her and it always worked. Probably helped that Id done it so many times that I knew all of her info by heart.~~As an onsite IT tech, 99% of the time, I introduce myself to tech support as ""this is Greeneggpage, and I am calling on behalf of Mr Bob Bobson."" And I hand the phone over if verification is needed.

The 1% of the time is when they aren't present but I have their permission to pretend to be them. Last time, I was pretending to be my brother-in-law wondering why his cable internet was so slow. Turns out the ISP was giving him a $10/month credit for having a 3mpbs connection. That's the low end of DSL... I called back the next day to upgrade after getting his permission.~~When I worked in a bank call centre we were able to just block the account to force them into branch under the pretence of their account being locked out on the system and it wont tell us why, it just says Branch visit required unfortunately  Then when the account holder jumps on the line to moan about it and try to pass security, welp too late!~~Had an employee that a collector was calling about. 
""What is the call about""

""It's a business matter""

""I own this business, you can talk to me about any business matters""

""It's a personal business number""

""They aren't allowed personal calls, I suggest calling them on their personal number for personal business""

""Do you have their number""

""Yes""

""May I have it""

He used a bad word for some reason.~~yep, those are always fun people to deal with.  'well sir, if you'd like to discuss your feelings on our service, i'll be more than happy to xfer you to someone who will take down your thoughts and information, and really they'd better be able to assist you with this than coming down here'  hahaha.  i've never had to use scripts to that extent.  but yes, a few things you learn quickly, never give the call center address, and never give your last name.  ~~I'm ALMOST out of debt from my stupidity from when I was younger, just waiting out the last few months of my final 2 hits to my record, but damn if any of the 5x removed buyers of my debt from back when I was an idiot from years before ever called me and said ""hey instead of 100x your debt, we'll let you go for just what you owed and clean your credit"" I would jump on it immediately.

They would have bought the debt for 1 cent on the dollar and they'd make bank on profits. ~~Eh, you took it personal, you can't do that or else you lose.

Of course he's going to talk to *you* but that's because *you* are on the line, *you* are just the guy he has to deal with. Customers will try to get some sympathy or empathy but that's not because they actually think you are a good person, and they don't get nasty because you are a bad person, they react any other way depending on how you represent the company's interest vs what they want/need

I'd have given him the information, tell him my opinion is irrelevant since it does not represent the company's opinion hence it won't even affect the outcome and let him go.

Not saying you had to do that for him, I'm saying you should do that for yourself. It's a burden to take matters personally in customer service.~~Ten years ago a customer said to me ""I'd like to speak to a manager"" and when I told him none were available he said to me ""Well who would you tell if there was a fire?""

So I said the fire brigade. He didn't like that. But why the fuck am I telling a manager that there's a fire?!~~You handled this well and your ""okay"" response is exactly what I would have done!

Seriously though!!! Person who absolutely cannot under ANY circumstances have ANY stress WHATSOEVER is calling and yelling their butt off---oookay then! Perhaps authorize someone else to speak for you or call when you've calmed down?~~I talked to someone who had used all her extensions, plus bonus catastrophe extensions, plus no-longer-offered promo deferred payments. When she was denied more assistance, she just kept asking ""what do you people consider hardship, do I have to get hit by a bus?"" 

My internal monologue said ""go on, maybe you'll get a settlement from the driver and be able to pay your damn bill!""~~I work on the customer service side of a military health insurance service. We have had to call law enforcement on people all over the world because they were a danger to themself or others and either they called for help or someone concerned did. It's a good thing, but tense.~~Im my industry it's so funny when they lawyer up. You have a free impartial ombusman that I actively recommend you go to first after me because they will explain if you are right or wrong and you can go from there.

When I refused, he gave me a month to move out. Been 10 years since I moved back home to my friends and Ive never been happier.~~This is why every call should be recorded at all call centers but especially collection ones. With today's computer systems there's no reason not to. And supervisors should listen before they call. 

Nothing like being able to tell a customer that you listened to the call and even the referenced call from x months ago and not only was the staff member not rude but yes you were told you had to pay ~~I used to work for a bank doing customer support in a call center. This guy calls through fully verified ( meaning he input his bank account details, date of birth and security code) he gets through me and starts rattling a list of tools he wanted to order.

I stopped him long enough to tell him he called the bank and not the hardware store, he insists I'm wrong, I told him that he did indeed call the bank and tries to insist that I'm wrong. Finally I tell him well if I'm at the hardware store then I'm in the wrong work place and I hung up~~This always killed me. I worked in customer service for a hospital network. We had many folks on payment plans. We sent statements out monthly, but folks could choose to do e-statements via their mychart. I had several folks who would miss payments and then get a past due bill, or sent to collections because of non-payment. It was always our fault according to them. I was told by folks that they hadn't received a statement. My answer to that was usually ""I'm sorry about that, but even if you didn't receive a statement for some reason, you knew you had a payment plan that was due monthly. If you have a car payment, chances are you don't get a statement monthly, but you still know you have to pay it every month, right?"".

End of subject. ~ Nope, they still want to argue. Had one female say that everything with the service was fine, she just didnt want to pay us because she was going on vacation and needed the money -.- She couldn't understand why we threatened to send her to collections after 90 days of non payment.

My county put $1k on my account for the next however many bills. That didn't erase the late fees or balance from before (I thought it did bc I didnt ask the right questions). I had broken up the late payments to stretch them out so I'd pay less $$ but eventually get caught up. After the $1k was used up I still had 2 payments left from my arrangement (that go on top of the current bill) I couldn't understand this and needed it explained like 5 times why there wasn't a zero balance. But believe me I was super nice and thankful for everything. I made the last payment last month so now, yes my account is in good standing and all cleared up. I can totally understand why this guy was confused. But you clearly explained it so he's just either dumb or not listening.~~My intuition/experience says that whenever someone says ""*Well I used to work there*"" they're not exactly lying, but rather than ""*I quit last year and know the systems*"" what they really mean is something along the lines of ""*5 years ago I worked in a completely unrelated department for a year*"".

As a general rule, if you intended on staying employed, it's a good idea to tread lightly, regardless of what you're saying. ~~A friend of mine bought a house that was on a do-not-deliver list. It took him going
to the store with papers proving he just bought the house and that it wasn't the previous owner to get removed. He said that the employee that he spoke to said that the note about it was that the former occupant used to try to 'tip' with sex toys. He said he seemed perfectly normal when he bought the house. People are crazy...~~How dare you not personally go to his home and punch him in the eye for ordering incompatible items. Obviously you live in his home and follow him around constantly or how could you possibly know he wasn't ordering a guitar as well as a case for a guitar he already has, which would be the obvious assumption when he ordered 2 different brands.~~My first job was outbound sales for telecommunications. One time of of our TL's (who was hired after me but promoted because he used to do drugs with the big boss) was showing us some examples of calls from some of the people on the floor who had the top conversation stats. It was pretty obvious that he hadn't listened to the calls first because the first call was just dead air: this guy had dialled his own mobile and sat there for 20 minutes. The next call was a different consultant who offered 2 separate plans that couldn't be offered together. The 3rd call was more dead air.~~Is anyone else scared that she's going to let her husband, who either never had a license or has had it revoked, drive the car, and that he will get into a horrible crash and harm someone? I mean, it just seems odd to me that she'd be making a huge deal about the license unless he doesn't have one, and just the way she's so insistent has me scared that he's going to end up driving.......~~I had a call recently from a legit debt collector, who wanted me to verify my identity before discussing anything with me. I don't like giving out information to anyone who calls me as they could be a scammer just looking for additional information. 

Since your organization made first contact with the text message, I'd be wary like this caller.~~The number people use to call my center is literally on the back of their credit and debit cards (for card maintenance and general card emergencies like fraud etc) and I still get accused of being a scammer. We only take incoming calls, so you called me, and you literally had to find this number on the back of your actual card but sure! Im scamming you by asking you to verify the last 4 digits of your social security number...~~I feel you on this one, I've given the bill amount to plenty of customers and they just flat out say ' I don't want to pay that much' you don't get to pick how much to pay it just is! Have dealt with some customers who thought the landlord was paying the bills then suddenly realise they owe . Why don't people question these things or read the tenancy agreements.~~You flat out refuse to do anything with only one spouse?   That is offensive.  If I call and say I want/need this, please come give me an estimate, I would expect you to come give me an estimate.  My family dynamic is not your business.  There are plenty of couples that one makes the decisions.  Where one makes the money, and says basically ""it's mine, I'll do what I want"", or one makes it and the other spends it.  There's the abusive ones, that come home and freak out because ""you should have taken care of this already""  and the opposite ""I'll do it, you just stay out of my way"".  The ""I don't care, you handle it"" couples...

To flat out refuse because my husband leaves these decisions 100% to me, is just insulting.~~Get out.

The long-term psychological effects from this will haunt you for the rest of your life. I left call center work over a year ago and am now a drafter/designer. Not a day goes by without me fighting a panic attack because I think I'm going to get fired over a minor mistake. Even though I get positive feedback and the guys help and teach me when I mess up, instead of criticize and degrade me. 

Anytime my manager has a meeting, I think it's with HR to fire me. Anytime a project manager says an order is wrong, even the ones who work a completely different product line, I assume it's something I did and I'm going to get fired. 

It's hell, man. I love my current job and I hate that old call center bs has seeped into this new chapter of my life. ~~It's obviously not your fault, but I hate companies that say they deliver by X day and then don't.

This valentines day, my boyfriend ordered my gift from a fairly big company that does a lot of chocolate covered strawberries and stuff like that. He paid an extra $10 to *guarantee* that it would arrive on the 14th, and was assured that it would have.

Except, it hadn't shipped until the 13th, and obviously it took another two days to arrive because they weren't sending it Next Day.

My boyfriend had to spend like an hour on the phone just to get a refund for the BS $10 guarantee. Turns out that for way more, you could have it guaranteed for Valentine's morning, and he was told he should've gotten that.~~Honestly, I used to do that once in a while even in the office! I worked the last shift so if I was stuck on a call no one was around.. Id sneak under my desk while I was still talking to them and just pull the power cord so it looked like the call dropped if  they happened to pull it. Whoops! You did the right thing ~~","The commenter agrees with the original poster's response to a customer's request for a water heater and suggests that the customer may have had a bad experience dealing with a flooded basement. However, they also express surprise that the customer's request for express delivery was allowed. They also mention that"
15.0,"When i did phone tech support for a tax software company we would occasionally get complicated calls that lasted literally hours bc...its obviously not the softwares fault but they would expect us to go above and beyond to solve the problem...most of the time i didnt mind id rather spend an hr plus helping one customer who was actively participating to fix the problem ten 40 idiots...

Longest call was well over 3 hrs...at about the 2 hr mark...i had to pee really had to pee. Messaged supervisor who told me i couldnt put customer on hold to pee said fuck that told customer i wanted to do some quick research in case the current thing didnt work would they mind being put on hold for a few minutes? Not a problem put them on hold went and peed and was back on line in less than 5

Got away with it after i told the sup next time ill just pee in your fucking trash can~~Oh gosh, I was so depressed at my call centre job I was having panic attacks every morning before the start of my shift.

One day I just thought enough is enough, and with encouragement from my husband, I was able to gather the courage to quit even though I had nothing else lined up. I took unpaid sick leave until my notice was up. It was honestly the best thing I ever did, and my depression improved almost instantly.

Took me about a month or two to find a new job, which thankfully wasnt a call centre job.~~  My Grammie had the HOA come after her for some flowers that I planted for her, because they were shorter than the other flowers! 

   I initially planted all of the flowers for her, for Mothers Day and some died, the HOA then complained about that, so I replaced them. Then the idiots complain that theyre not all the same height! Do I control the growth rate of a plant?! The HOA president was big into self help MLM schemes so I told the her Id give the short flowers a pep talk about growing faster and if that didnt work Id put signs and play self help tapes 24/7 encouraging them to do better! She claimed those schemes, she was so into, worked for every living thing and were guaranteed successes! She left my Grammie alone after that!~~I had a somewhat similar situation working for a wireless carrier. The woman was convinced that her phone was being hacked by the FBI and went on a very long rant about how they were performing satanic rituals on her while she slept. She wanted me to help her find any sort of tracking software that was on her phone.

It was deeply sad, but all I could do was listen and reassure her that her phone was free of anything extraneous.~~I literally just ended my day with a customer calling in to say what was sold to them is faulty and they wanted a refund, with no chance seeing the product again. I promptly told them off and eloquently informed them of self-love due to being a corporate store, good luck with your chances of getting a refund!

I work for a sandwich shop.~~I work appeals/complaints in supplemental insurance and this story is so relatable. Yeah, you don't get a refund just because you never had any claims. That's not how insurance works.

Also, we regularly get people who send in brochures for a different policy than the one they have, super mad that they don't get the benefit from the brochure. *face palm*~~I would have been done with her so quickly. ""Oh, why did you get that ticket in the first place? Ah, in our lot? That's a  problem for us and other customers. Please pay the ticket for your infraction.""

I bet you get some interesting calls for fast food, please post more!~~I have my own tree surgery business here in the UK, earlier in the year I had a customer badmouth my 1 and only employee and despite us already having taken a load of branches of his tree being there for about an hour I told him basically to shove his tree and we packed our stuff up, left the branches in his garden and drive and left.

Sorry but not all bosses are wankers.~~What gets me is that, from her statement, it seems she has some sort of refrigeration device, so this isn't an absolute crisis, where she cannot store any food/have anything cold, it's just a matter of walking, which made me laugh. I mean, in the big scheme of things, walking through the house to the other freezer is not a super big deal, and she's making it so much more stressful for everyone than it has to be. She's her own biggest problem, not your service techs.~~I feel you. So much. I work for a place that sells exercise equipment and bikes and stuff. Our instructions are pretty decent and we have videos as well that get sent out automatically when your order is shipped. We still get asked the most basic questions. I have at least one person a week ask for us to send a tech out to do it for them. We don't offer assembly services and we never have.~~I work for an online retailer and this story reminds me of one of my own. I recently received a complaint from a woman stating that her package had been ripped open and the contents spilled on her front porch. She was very disappointed and thinking of ordering from a different merchant in the future. I dont know if she thought we hand delivered all our packages, then ripped them open and strew their contents about haphazardly, but we definitely use UPS, FedEx, and USPS. And even then, it sounded like they delivered a perfectly whole package that mustve been targeted by thieves. But she blamed us.~~8 months is pretty standard call-centre burnout/turnover.

I honestly think that once people start throwing around insults and abuse you should be able to terminate the call. Maybe if everyone adopted this policy, we'd have a better class of customer. Instead, we have to pander and deal with it to keep every last ounce of business.~~Sorry you went through that. I hate the xx:59 o'clock call that holds you past your shift.

I have a way out of it with my company. It's an unspoken rule that our QA scorers do not listen to calls over 5 or 6 minutes. As soon as I get an asshole like that and the call time ticks past 5 minutes with no end in sight, I throw out the ""don't talk over the customer"" rule. I start interrupting them, talking over them, asking them direct questions, and not letting them expound with useless details. Most of the time it let's me take control of the call, or forces them to cut to the point, or offends them and they hang up. Either of those results are ok to me. Your solution is a good idea since I'm working from home now too, I might give that a try.~~Your manager wasn't required to live monitor aht/aux? We got hourly reports for aht and could see you switch from inbound to outbound. 

This would have been picked up quick. I once had a rep who would warm transfer and then sit on the line on mute. Basically call avoidance, just thought he was smarter then me.~~Fellow call center person. My place is talking a big game of moving us around so we arent all close together but I know that isnt happening. They did relax the attendance policy so if you cant come due to the virus either symptom related or child care since the schools are closed you dont get paid but you dont get into trouble. They took away paper plates and plastic utensils in the break room and that is just about it. 

And no work from home option since its all healthcare related.~~Based on when you said ""if we start losing clients"", I'm going to assume you work at a third party call center, get out now. You have made it to management, you can parlay to so many better opportunities, there is no reason to waste your thirties working for a third party center when all they will do is offer you less money and less real opportunity.  ~~Trust me, it is much much more fun to keep your cool. When jerks act like that, they WANT to make you angry. They feel stupid because they don't know how to fix their issue, and feeling stupid makes them angry. So they want someone to give them a reason to yell and make silly threats like calling corporate to get a level 1 CSR fired. 

Staying calm and speaking in a soft, pleasant voice while the customer is raging and frothing at the mouth actually makes them madder! Because you won't engage them. I love doing this--they deserve it. Plus it makes me look good if QA reviews the call. Most of the time when they can't rattle me, they get so angry that they (a) Become abusive, at which point I can warn them and then hang up, or (b) Hang up out of sheer frustration. Either a or b is a win for me! ~~Someone called the poor folks at the city where I live and complained about me. I got a note on my door from them saying I had too many cats, and I needed to do something about it right away. 

I am sure my big dog barked them off the porch when they delivered that note. I sent an email about the zero cats I actually have, and they have not been back out. ~~It's OK. Over here at Derp Satellite we get those ladies when they can't get the picture up on the screen. Try actually having to get them *push buttons on a remote*. You'd think I asked them to disable a nuclear warhead with 3 minutes to detonate. Well, I take that back. They may actually be a little more relaxed in that case, because I honestly believe they'd rather be a heap of charred toxic waste than go without TV.~~When they call in with *none* of the needed information to hand.  
  
""Can I get your car registration/policy number?""  
""I didn't know I'd need that let me go out to my car/rummage through my elaborate filing system-""  
  
*You are calling your car insurance.* It doesn't take too much thought to prepare!~~You do not deserve the abuse. If you have the funds to be able to live for a little bit while looking for a new job, take the opportunity and do yourself a favor and leave. Escalations is no joke and the mental toll cannot be maintained in the long term. Get out! You won't regret it. And don't ever look back with rose-colored glasses. I make that mistake sometimes because I had great coworkers who made things ""tolerable."" You got this. Best of luck in your job search!~~I'm sure this made sense to you, but I had to re-read to figure out the gist of the story. Generally tales are more interesting when described a bit more clearly rather than just hammering out dialogue - sometimes a bit of explanation (eg in this case, for those who don't use multiple input channels on one tv) or a bit of detail might help. 

Just a thought, in case it helps explain the down votes to you. ~~","The commenter used to work as a phone tech for a tax software company and had to deal with long, frustrating calls from customers who didn't want to be put on hold for a few minutes.

15.0,"Due to PCI compliance reasons, it was business as usual for us too. 

But, governments are taking action (Netherlands).
And a full lockdown can be expected. The countries around us are already in lockdown mode. So citizens there are not allowed to go to work. Unless they have jobs that are vital in this crisis (health care/police/fire)

So... we moved to WFH within a week. 
A lot of stuff needed to be reorganized. But they managed. And the first people started to WFH today.~~Yea. Last summer my call center job put me in such a bad state that I ended up in the psych ward for two weeks. I quit right after I got out and it only took me a couple weeks to find a new job. It was the best decision I have made to date. I am no longer suicidal and I feel so much lighter. It paid well but it's just not worth it.~~I was a team leader at a call centre years and years ago, and was disgusted by how often we'd have people pretending to work.  It was always more work to pretend to work than it was to work, but they'd do it and I'd need to spend hours auditing call logs and reviewing recordings to catch them.~~I worked for an entertainment company. We had competitors. Whenever customers were on the verge of not getting their way, they would say, ""Well, maybe I should just cancel my services with *company*! How does that sound?""

I would just respond back in a matter-of-fact tone, ""If you believe that is for the best, I can certainly help you out with that. Are you sure you want to continue with cancellation?"" Some of them would change their tune so fast, caught completely off guard that I didn't play into their bullshit.

Of course I had to say that for a cancellation request. If I could say what I wanted to say for the obnoxious customers making that request, I would say, ""As Ariana Grande says, we got one less problem without you.""~~I order a lot of plants online and those are almost always express shipped (for obvious reasons) and there is almost always a couple days for processing. I usually don't mind too much except if it takes longer than a week AND they made me pay for the express shipping. There are some companies that will pick up the shipping cost and those I allow a little more time to process before getting upset. 
There was this one asshole on Etsy who made me pay $15 for express shipping and then took 5 WEEKS to put my plants in the mail. His page stated 5 to 7 DAYS processing then express shipping. I was in the middle of trying to get a refund and about to call the credit card company (he wasn't responding to calls emails I had been sending for the previous 3 weeks and Etsy was less than helpful) when the plants finally got shipped and he finally contacted me with an apology email with about 3 excuses about why they were late ~~What I want to know is who buys a guitar with the wrong type of case? I don't know very much about acoustics, and I guess that could be the reason behind this dude's mishap, but if you're getting an electric guitar, it either fits in a standard case, or it's a Gibson/Epiphone, which needs a Les Paul case. There's really not too much in between.~~I'm right here with you. My GF works in a small phone group as well, one of the few people unable to fully work from home. I'm one of a handful of employees required to be at the TV station while everyone else is working from home. Even though they cut us back to a skeleton crew, so we should be relatively safe from infection, it's still kind of spooky coming into the ghost town every day.

We're all going to get through this together, just take it day by day.~~oh I can relate. I don't honestly know how many prompts and transfers it will take for a caller to reach me. But I started off ""Hi this is DPB on a record line! I'm here to assist!"" There was a brief dead air and then a lady revs up her voice with ""How come you have so many fucking &lt;loud and enunciated racial slur&gt; on your commercial!?"" I hung up on her and cackled for a solid munute.~~Im sorry youre having to go thru that! I actually did quit mid shift one day because I was tired and overwhelmed and I had nothing lined up. Unfortunately, I ended up back in another center because of bills &amp; the pay is decent and it was a quick hire with working from home. Luckily, this one is far more bearable and Im just slightly unhappy vs utterly miserable at that other place. Im still looking for something outside of call centers tho. They just suck period when youre speaking to entitled ungrateful customers. So if you can get out, I urge you to do so asap!!!~~Yeeeah I'm not saying this is the case with where you work or the websites you get data from. But I've been called by people like you because I had a (private) student loan about 7 years ago and they sold/gave away my contact information. Started getting calls about 3 years later and eventually just changed my phone number because I had moved anyway. 

Clearly a lot of those people do need more education. But unless you know definitively that those sites are operating 100% legitimately without obtaining information from third parties, maybe cut some a little slack.~~I had a similar story recently that was more funny than sad.  I work at a bank so a customer was calling to set up a dispute on a transaction.  This woman's 13 year old granddaughter had snuck into her purse and stolen her debit card. Then proceeded to use the card to purchase a porno of two people from Love and Hip Hop on the grandmother's tablet. When I then informed her we can not process a charge as fraud because it was a family member that commited the crime and they will have to press charges against her granddaughter she came up with the best soulution.  ""I am just going to make her where a sign stating she is paying for the porn she bought. Then make her go beg for change.""~~A friend of mine got fired for this type of thing. He thought he was muted and said something to the effect of ""Oh stop acting like whiny spoiled cunt you stupid bitch"". Customer overhead and rightfully lost her mind. He was walked out about 30 minutes later. In his defense I heard the call later on in a meeting and the customer quite frankly was being a whiny cunt. She was complaining that we wouldn't replace a pair of earbuds that she had damaged,and she admitted to it on the call, as a result after being told no about 6 different ways she just started being a flaming cunt to my friend. Frankly if it were me I would have told her that this is the final answer in the matter either pay for a new pair or don't and then I would have disconnected the call.~~I love when I get to tell people that the person they spoke with isnt in the office today. They always are surprised, like we live at the office 24/7, and never even go to the bathroom.   The callers seem to think we are always just sitting around, nothing to do, waiting for their call. ~~Yeah, I triple check everything when I pay for express delivery on anything. And have several times made companies refund my shipping when they guarantee arrival by a specific time. As long as I ordered before your clearly posted cut off time. I dont care, express means express, not were going to dick around in the warehouse before we ship your order for 2days. ~~Why do customers bring up religion on business calls? It's so awkward. I don't mind if they're just being nice and say something like, ""Bless you for helping me!"" or something. But if they start asking about what religion I am, I get deeply uncomfortable. That's just not appropriate. As an agnostic myself, I usually just tell people I grew up Catholic and they leave it alone. But I've had a couple calls expound on how awesome their particular faith is and it's just weird to me.~~&gt;  They made up bogus rules and treated us like children 

Good on you for leaving. For the uninitiated, all call centers are set up to quickly squash any overperformance that might merit a raise. If they ever catch you figuring out how to follow the rules AND still retain some shred of job satisfaction, they will very quickly create more rules until you suck again. The only way to win is not to play.~~Yeah I feel you.  My current job and precious one Ive been in similar situations, taking calls for people that are late on their bills (for the most part thats why people call it seems).  There are many who are mature enough to take responsibility for it and just want to pay it back.   

The ones that are the problem customers are like the ones you  are talking about.  Calling in saying theres NO WAY that its their fault that they owe this or they are confused as to why their arrangements defaulted because they didnt pay on time or pay anything at all.   They curse us out and yell and argue.  Its just a lot and annoying to have to put up with it every day.      

  It can definitely add up and get to you, making it hard to not feel like sometimes its a personal attack on you wish they cuss you out.~~Yep, couldnt stand the customer abuse. Customer service is one thing but getting cussed out in your home (work from home) is another situation. I quit my job, worked enough OT over the last month to save up for a bit and Im just traveling for the next couple of months. You can always find a better job, your mental health and well-being is more important~~Depends on the centre and how well you're treated/get paid. I get paid poverty level wages at my current centre and am constantly whipped into being on the phone no matter what and have to put up with some real assholes (hence why I'm bailing in the new year).

 So yes, occasionally if I get a really horrendous screecher or nasty bastard who doesn't want to be helped but just wants to scream and treat me as a verbal punchbag I'll usually switch them on and off hold for extended periods or kick them over to another department. If you're using CCE workspace CTRL + D is your best friend.~~I've actually done it a couple of times but it was because it was super slow and they didn't like us sitting for more than 5 minutes so they'd tell us to just call a random number real quick so a bunch of us would just call our cells. We always hung up when it went to vm tho. So it's not really call avoidance in that case. But there was someone in our sister office that got caught doing it as call avoidance.  Worse part is after they were caught and talked to about it, they still continued to do it.~~&gt;Then I will sue your company and you personally!

Luckily my company allows us to hang up when they threaten to file a lawsuit. ""Since you are planning on suing us I cannot help you any more and you will have to direct all inquiries to our legal department. Thanks for calling. &lt;click&gt;""~~",The commenter had a bad experience working at a call center and quit after two weeks. They found it difficult to catch people pretending to work and had to deal with customers who were rude and unhelpful. They also mentioned that some companies take longer to process orders than others.
15.0,"&gt;Now...before you go any further...what do you have to say for yourself?

YOU ARE RIGHT MY LIEGE! I CLEARLY AM NOT WORTHY TO SHARE VOICE SPACE WITH YOU UPON THE TELEPHONE! I SHALL SHAMEFULLY EXCUSE MYSELF FROM YOUR AUDIBLE PRESENCE SO AS TO PRESERVE YOUR SHINING BRILLIANCE!! 

-----

also your username just gave me a great idea for a custom Zaku II kit. dunno if thats what your username refers to but regardless im inspired now.~~What I hate (when calling into a call center) is the normal cadence for giving an address is street, city, state, then zip. But most software can figure out the city from the zip, so you get this awkward hiccup where you expect to say the city then zip, but the agent wants zip code before the city.  So you talk over them accidentally, and it takes a second to get back on track. 

Just one of those stupid things you notice after working in a call center forever. ~~This is one of the problems with surveys. The bad payer will get mark you bad because of their financial problems. Your bosses will them blame you because you don't show empathy or smile down the phone.

In some call centers, QA will fail the call because you didn't do enough to de-escalate and keep the screamer from hanging up. ~~No don't sweat bullets you have the company notes backing you up. They can cry scream squeal it doesn't matter if you are following procedure and someone higher than you said no delivery. If the customer can override stuff like that with a tantrum no reason to even have notes like that.~~Did it last year. Decided unemployment was better than fighting them to keep me employed despite my FMLA usage. Spent a few months doing mountain things with my dog and besties over the summer, then got a part time job that screwed me over basically (made too much to keep getting unemployment, but didn't get enough hours to make it financially worthwhile) and finally landed a new permanent job in Nov. Those last couple months were stressful AF though because I wasn't finding anything good to apply for. Grateful I got the gig I did because it's perfect, but I was nervous about it.~~Where we work, If a customer says they're recording the conversation we just say 'I do not give my permission for this. I will need you to confirm that you have stopped the recording, and deleted it before I am able to proceed' 

If they don't, or say they haven't, we can politely disconnect the call~~I work for a bank and get people like this. We're an inbound call center so I just don't understand this logic. I usually just tell them to hang up and call the number on the back of their card or step into a branch. I don't have time for this fuckery.~~I'm in the same boat someone in another department close to mine came to work even though their partner tested for covid19 and they have been sent home but they are not releasing any other details and keeping 
us in the dark about what was cleaned and who they made contact with because my department shares the same breakroom as theirs. Where I live every non-essential worker is suppose to be not working atm and my company is letting everyone work from home except the call center which is bullshit since it is pretty quite this time of year and I take on average 10-15 calls a day its brutal~~That's why I never answer a call if there is less than 5 minutes before I leave. Luckily, my call center is slow enough, this isn't an issue, and is actually something we are told to do by higher ups so they don't have to pay us for extra time.~~This sounds like you should have called adult protective services or whatever they are called for a check up, because he was (only very slightly obscured) telling you hes going to kill Hk self because of your companys handling of the case. Either a credible threat, or a good life lesson for him to not joke about suicide.~~I used to manage third party sick pay claims.
The plans were purchased by companies to cover their employees. In some instances the employees had to cover the insurance premiums through payroll deductions. This led many employees to think they ought to be able to decide the terms of the policy. 

One plan required employees to use up their employer paid sick leave before being able to access the additional coverage. This made some people angry because it meant they had to wait 30 days. I dont know how many people I explained to that no, they couldnt change the plan because paying premiums didnt mean they owned the plan. Their employer controlled it.~~I did indeed. I had taken a half day, woke up, and was like, I don't think I want to work there anymore. Responsibility creep due to absentee leadership combined with a wage freeze did it for me. Had been there 10+ years. I'd been dithering for a bit, when I finally decided I felt light as air. My roommate was far more worried, lol.

Gave a month's notice. I was going to get six weeks PTO payout, I figured I'd hook up with a temp agency if I hadn't found anything by the time it ran out.

Took one interview halfway through my notice period, got offered the job, started a week after I finished at the other one.

I never had trouble with the customers, it was entirely the company. I just hit 3 years at my new cc.~~If you cuss at the reps at my job you warn them once and if they continue being potty mouths you can hang up on them immediately. If this is a continuing problem with this customer then security will terminate their account. 

No need to put up with their shit.
~~I think I worked at this same company when I first started doing CSR work. It rhymes with Drop MVP??

What I always hated was when we would advertise a piece of jewelry with 4 or 5 different colors or stones to choose from. Of course when the blue necklace with the pearl sold out, that would be the one that every single caller wanted. They wouldn't accept the gold necklace with the diamond, oh NO! Had to be the one that was gone. Then I'd get an entitled rant about how poor the customer service was, and how I did not know how to do my job since the item sold out in like 30 minutes. I definitely do not miss all the old rich ladies one bit! 

&gt;intoxicated monkey could do it..

hahahaha~~&gt; Lady if that's all it takes to get you that upset then you are one sheltered woman.

Or you could look at it with a sense of pride.  Your company's propaganda is so good, that people cry when the can't buy an item they didn't know existed 10 minutes ago.
~~People like that is why I love having the ability to refuse you service or to completely shut off your service. We one time we told the lady we expected her to send us an apology letter before we turn her tv service back on for how she treated my team.~~I had one of these. I work at a callcenter for a bank and a man received a text message from someone claiming to be his bank, with a number to call. He called the number, put in his bank card and password, and then hung up and called the number on the back of his card. 

Once I explained to him that the initial number he called was a scammer and wed have to cancel his card, he got extremely paranoid, said I was the scammer and hung up?! Lol he called the number on the back of his card so Im not sure how much more legitimate it could get! I had to block his card after he hung up due to compromised info.~~I have people alllll the time call and bitch that their treadmill or whatever doesnt include free labor for someone from our company to come set it up. It clearly says in the presentation and description that it requires assembly and it wouldnt be this cheap, or sold on tv/internet, if it included that!!! I work for a major e-commerce/retail television channel. What makes you think we have dedicated staff ready all over the country to come set up the shit you got delivered in the mail?! People are so fucking idiotic! I got someone the other day who demanded to be compensated for the set up labor she purchased on her own by a third party to set up her product. Like no bitch Im not going to reimburse you for that. Especially because you just got nasty with me. ~~The bit about them dating ""I'm not stupid"" hit close to home. I work for a refrigerator manufacturer. We use all glass shelves they are slightly tapered with the narrow ends to the back of the machine. People like to take them out to clean them for some reason and then try to stick then in backwards. Usually the customers call up claiming the liner inside bowed out or are swollen. 

Trying to tell someone that they are putting a shelf in backwards without sounding condescending is hard. Any time it's by email I get a raging response of someone telling me they aren't stupid and I need to give them a new machine, etc. People on the phone usually get embarrassed and thank me. ~~This type of person is horrendous - I can barely tolerate someone as demanding as this. I also get this but in email form. This is an email conversation I had:

Dude: I need you too look at this - D was helping me but I see hes not in until tomorrow. I need an update now! 

Me: Sorry I dont have any access to his emails. I dont know what hes done with this matter (aka Im not fucking psychic)

Dude: thats not good enough I need an update today! 

Me: He is not in today. I cannot help you. He will help you tomorrow I assure you.
~~I always get a kick out of how clueless some people are. I get this person is probably having the day from hell since her water heater went out out, but I never get why people like that always have to take it out on someone else. I hope she found a reputable plumber as I wouldnt want a medical testing company installing my water heater~~Should have just tried to sell her the water heater.

""Well ma'm since it's our only water heater and it's currently being used, I must warn you it's got a few years on it, and if you really want it we could probably part with it for something like, oh I dont know, let's say (something absurd) about $10,000. Its going to be a while till you can have it though.~~I once got a call where someone one said we knowingly sold them a faulty system because a Water cooling unit failed on them. The kicker was the item was purchased 4 years ago and put him out of our warranty for sometime. He couldn't accept that no matter what item it is, no one can predict when or if  something will fail. By that logic, everything in the world is knowingly faulty.~~","The commenter states that they are not willing to share their voice space with someone on the phone. They also mention that it can take a second to get back on track after accidentally giving the wrong address. They also mention that in some call centers, the customer's behavior can be difficult to handle"
15.0,"Ah my bank call center is doing the same thing. We had 4 people on my team come contact with it, but it's business as usual too. It completely stresses me out, I told them that my husband is immunocompromised and I will kill him if I bring something home and they're just saying ""wash your hands!!!"" I hate it.~~Why for the love of all the turquoise earth do people do this?! Im Christian, but my religion has absolutely no place in my work environment. Its my choice, my deal. I endeavor not to preach to others cuz its rude, inconsiderate, and just plain disrespectful. And when its in the workplace, its bad business all around. Whether its the employee or the customer should not matter.~~Its sad that all companies dont realize this is the way to do it. They lose so many great employees.

Where I work now (not call center) this is how we are treated. Its still customer service but a whole new ballgame. Unfortunately had to take a huge pay cut but its worth it (benefits are great at least).~~I also worked for a health insurance company and had this situation weekly so I can relate on a deeply personal level! I can understand when they never claim so not sure how policy works, especially with old people but its the ones that call in multiple times before the treatment, get told everytime that its not covered and then still go ahead and expect it to be paid. Do they think we cant leave notes on the account or something and one day the will get someone who just says, ""yeah sure have a 10k treatment that isnt covered, cant see why that would be a problem!"" Dicks!~~I used to work in a similar education referral place except the leads we got were from job sites that forced the person to sign up for school info in order to get to the job application. Very deceptive, and people were generally pissed off about it. I hated it.~~Wow. Here, in the US, we would be allowed to disconnect the call if a person started using racial slurs or cursing. You get to warn them first, and then if they don't calm down and stop using offensive language, you can hang up on them. 

Sorry you had to deal with suck a closed-minded jerk. It's one of the reasons I only do outbound calling. I get rude people occasionally, but not all the time.~~Wow, what a dick.  Mr. High&amp;Mighty over here......  I'm a pretty negative, pessimistic person by nature (*because of assholes like this*), but I don't treat CSRs, retail clerks, or cashiers like shit or like I'm better than them.  A simple ""*Sorry, but no thanks.*"" should have been the end of it.~~For a major US cell carrier when you sign a contract, you agree that you can sue, but no one is supposed to listen to you. However if you take them to arbitration over $50 they will settle for $1000 because if a judgment by arbiter is 1 cent over their peremptory written offer, you get $10k min, and your lawyer gets double their rate if you have one.~~CSB: Had a (medically diagnosed) crazy roommate more than a decade ago who used to pull the same shit. He would go into this whole ""You're depriving X from a mentally disabled person! You'll be arrested! I'm calling my lawyer!"" over every little thing that didn't go his way and eventually to both me and the utility companies when they shut off everything for nonpayment while he was being evicted. If you can't guess I got the hell out of there.~~I am also with the company that rhymes with barter. I also agree about the QA - i'm never able to crack above a 72, no matter what I do. I have a 1x1 this week to look over 'what i'm missing,' but when my sup listens to any of my calls (without my knowledge) i'm constantly cracking 95-100. The QA is a joke, tbh.~~Lol, I just got a 56% QA, and the description of the call was not even close to what actually happened (I had to listen to it with my sup). I think people who get fired for QA are people they are looking to get rid of anyway, unless it's consistently bad.~~You can (feasibly) do something like this with the Tax Office.  If you know you are due a return you can flag that this not be released to you this year and leave it in to offset any tax debts. If you know that you are going to be in the clear, it will sit there and accumulate interest in the same manner as money you owe the Tax office generates interest.~~Wow, that stinks! I would be shocked if a co worker did that. What is really disappointing is that CSR did it to a *nice customer*. Of all the customers I've had that deserved a rant like this.... 

Seriously though, not cool of CSR. You're not supposed to say you want to actually kill a customer! Jebus! I mean everyone has had a horrible customer and thought ""Oh gosh I could KILL this cx right now!!"" but to say it out loud like you *mean it*? CSR apparently didn't need her job. ~~One thing that was emphasized during my training is that you cannot trust the mute button. It may be broken on a particular phone. It may not engage when you think you pressed it.

I know of two agents who were walked because they thought they were on mute and decided to bitch about the customer who could hear them the entire time.~~Hmm, this is interesting. We've had the same call at our company in the past couple or days. Ours has a list of 17 now or something and just asks to be put through to the CEO. Wonder if we work for the same place, also in pensions! Although I would have no idea what a customer would mean if they wanted to ""process a trade""... I'd assume switch funds.~~Urgh! I hate that when a customer refuses to allow you to follow the escalation policy because they KNOW that ""nothing will be done!""

Why on earth are you calling then??? I swear some people aren't happy unless they're complaining.

I had a chick recently get irate because I was trying to suggest &amp; offer solutions to her issues.~~I do primarily outbound calling so quite often people think we're trying to scam them. I do offer to confirm their address, last 4 numbers of credit card, their birthdate just to prove that yes, you have an account with us. 

Or I tell them I don't need any personal info (unlike actual scammers who are trying to fish for info).~~&gt;Me: Okay we are getting a lot of these calls...

My QA department: It is inappropriate to advise the caller we are getting a lot of these calls...


Multiple times Ive had to send in rebuttals to my graded calls qaing QA. They rarely have been changed, but I also used to rarely give a shit. Anymore, I am completely out of the giving shits. 

They have a way of forcing you into corners and preventing you from providing even decent customer service, while also meeting QA/AHT goals, all designed to frustrate you out of the job so you never become full time and earn benefits. Were located in a college town, so there is an endless supply of souls to crush. ~~&gt; ""if you don't put me in contact with a human being at &lt;airline&gt; I will keep this up until I make life miserable for a LOT of people!""

Mainly herself, once she gets banned from calling and the company will only communicate via email. 

Considering call center workers deal with screaming psychopaths several times a day, all that kind of abusive nonsense results in is the caller being banned from calling and sometimes even being denied service altogether. That is, at the end of the day, the workers go home to whatever we got going on, hopefully forgetting all about her, but she's still the one that's dealing with a problem she can't fix on her own and needs our help with it, but now cannot because she's banned. The amount of misery she can inflict is tiny compared to the misery she is purposefully inflicting upon herself. But hey, we're each the hero of our own story, I guess.~~They take good care of us where I'm at. But we are not a third party, we are the direct company. We do have third party (and I have heard they are also taken care of quite well and paid just as much as we are). But that doesn't stop them from doing the worst job ever. Which stresses us out even more. But I've been here a while now and this company has been the nicest to me out of all the companies I've ever worked for. Recently I was sick and was going to just force myself to go to work. But I was told no, stay home, get better, come back when you're better. So I'd say they are looking out for US. Not just the company dollars.~~This is so weird to me. I work in a call center but there is only 5 of us. Its a very specialized expert role. I usually work from home 3-5 days per month and more if I want. I prefer to go into the office usually though cause I go stir crazy. 

They currently have us working from home until mid April during this. 

Call centers are easy to work from home. I dont understand why your management isnt letting you do that. Our team has been doing this for 2 years and there is no drop in productivity, maybe even more so. 

Im sorry theyre idiots.~~The same situation here in Australia. 

My employer (work in the same industry to you) only just announced that they are reviewing work from home as a potential option but nothings confirmed. If the situation gets worse, and we are called for a lockdown nationwide, we're fucked for a lack of a better description. There's been no contingency in place if something does need to happen.

There haven't been any confirmed cases at my work or building, but it's only a matter of time I feel.

I can't say for sure, but it feels like the Australian government is going to call a lockdown in the next month. The Federal government has put restrictions on the amount of people in the same space from 500 to 100. But we need to see what happens first.~~Same boat! I work in a HIPAA compliant company and we have the same restrictions about the separated room, I have barking dogs as well. Our city may be put under a shelter in place order as well. Our company also doesn't pay for the required phone line and internet connection that some of us can't afford. Stay safe in there!!~~I think we work at the same company... I am at another site closer to the beach. Just one small building. We are also working from home. You might want to use your PTO. They aren't giving repercussions for dock time.

\*edit to add\* I realized I sounded unsympathetic. My apologies. Hang in there, OP!~~","The commenter works at a bank call center and is frustrated with customers who are rude and disrespectful.

They also mention their own experience with a health insurance company where they were treated poorly"
15.0,"I feel you. My job can absolutely 100% be done from home. They let us use our cell phone during work so we know hipaa isn't a huge issue for them, we don't handle ssn either. Yet they are conducting business as usual. Nothing has been sanitized as often as they claimed it would be. I care for my elderly sick mother and my daughter and I'm really worried about their health. Our company is a joke, they don't care about our health and the ironic thing is that our company is in the health industry.~~To the original poster: I do understand your reasoning. I think it may be losing you some business.

I think my wife would refuse to do business with your company if you told her you wouldn't accept an order from her unless I am there, too. She would just go to one of your competitors who would deal with her.~~Were the same, but a small company and c/s is a team of 4 (and we have over 60years at the company between us) no call times, no recording. The job is not perfect ... lots of redundancies last year and when they didnt know what to do with the tasks those people did... give it to customer services team. Just wish the pay would reflect it (fighting our corner on that one at the moment and our director gave us the ammunition we need a department of 4 takes in 60% of the revenue but on less pay than the 15 people who take in the other 40%)~~Ohhh boy I work roadside assistance and I feel you on this. They changed it so you can do monthly payments now instead of one big payment and the number of people calling for service has almost tripled. And people call in and act like they're the ONLY person to have broken down and don't understand why it's been 30 mins and no one has arrived....ummm even if we weren't super busy, no one can get to you in less than 30min unless they happen to be right next to you.~~What your manager hears is that you want him to spend more money to get better staff when he knows that he is already paying them the most allowed under contract, so there is nothing he can do but try to hire better people at the same money which he knows wont get you better people.~~As a manager in my last call center that I worked in, if I found someone dropping a call on a customer they would essentially be placed in front of a firing squad and barring some fantastical exceptional circumstance, that would be the last anyone would see of them.

Few things are as damaging to a company's brand image as shitty customer support like that.

Even as an agent, I can safely say that the only time I've ever hung up on a customer has been when they've gone beyond the point of actual words and cannot be reasoned with at all e.g. screaming and utterly unintelligible.~~I hate that! I had a similar situation where this chick didn't want to wait on the phone for me to do the stuff she wanted to do, she just wanted to give me her fucking list and hang up. When I told her I needed her in the phone to confirm each order she said she was a very busy woman and didn't have time to waste.~~75 per hour WTF? That's like $120 per hour!

&gt;okay sir, should you provide sufficient proof that this call and previous calls have incurred a genuine loss to yourself at the rate of 75 per hour we would be happy to investigate that for you. Otherwise we do not reimburse for time spent on the phone, especially at such exaggerated rates.

After he called me an 'incompetent fool' I would have just put him on mute and let him assume I hung up, likely shouting ""hello"" for several minutes like the moron he is. Personal insults are a fantastic way of making me give you the worst possible, slowest and most inconvenient service imaginable.~~Obligatory ""Just because you watch gay porn does not make you gay""  But ya when I was doing late night tech support for a major satellite provider I had this conversation a couple times a week.  The best was when someone would call in to ask me how to order it where it would never show up on the account.  Those were some fun conversations ~~* ""These are the steps we have to fix this issue; if you're not gonna do them then STFU and get off my line.""

* ""Just f-ing do this.""

* ""Don't yell at me, I'm trying to help you. Be civil to me or I'll cancel your account, sign it out of all devices, and change the email address.""

* ""Oh, your Internet is perfect? If it were then you wouldn't be calling me. ~~""I'm not going to troubleshoot"" - Then you shouldn't have called

""I don't feel the need to pay a fee"" - You can get the warranty, but wait... it takes awhile to be active, so you can wait 30 days and call back and create the TC, k? 

""I'm cancelling my service"" - Good luck getting out of the contract
~~&gt; I had one lady start crying on the phone because she couldn't get a ring. A ring. Just a piece of jewelry. Lady if that's all it takes to get you that upset then you are one sheltered woman.

You don't know what happened to her... I know that after a day gone wrong where I barely held it together, a simple statement that the coffee shop had no medium sized cups was enough to make me start crying, not because I was actually upset, but because that was the exhaustation, the entire situation just became too much and my brain just kinda shut down. ~~",The commenter sympathizes with the original poster's frustration with their company's lack of concern for their health and suggests that the company may be losing business.

Just had a customer who goes- I have a question about your light bulbs. And then nothing else for like a minute, not even typing.

I couldn't help myself. I go, I may have some answers, customer! :) Would you like to ask me those questions? 

He responded with fuck you and disconnected. ~~Ever since Oprah said she always asked for a supervisor, because theyre the experts, people have tried this game.

As we all know, a lot of supervisors actually know *less,* theyre just skilled at pushing the company line/AHT/sales. Certainly at least half Ive had were dimwits.

I ran into a former one after the centre closed who had taken some retraining in a technical role. He fucked up work I had done in preparation, and cut my wires so short I almost had to re-do them.

I also had to show him how to do his job....which he had supposedly been doing for a while.~~The hell with QA and micro managing assholes. Thats the reason why companies have so high turnover rates. You get screwed even when you helped the customer and they were 100 percent satisfied just because you didn't read a script word for word. 

Also, customers need to realize their issue isn't always going to be resolved. They need to understand its outside of your control and/or company policy to do certain things. They need to grow up and accept the customer isn't always right. 

We as support agents should not be expected to sugar coat everything so the customer feels all warm and fuzzy inside.~~We also offer chat support by Facebook messenger and text. One time someone accused me of being a robot so I responded with &lt;Error: response not found&gt; and the guy lost it and demanded to speak with someone real. Boss found it hilarious but also told me not to do it again.~~Ive recently started doing chat support as an at home adviser because of covid lockdown, and honestly, I thought frontline customer service was bad. The idiocy of chat is supreme. 

I love can I take the full billing address and they give the shortest form ever, and you have to continually probe with you seem to be missing some details, I need the FULL billing address 

Or I also love, when you start with some minimal formalities can I grab your first name or how are you today you just get help with order back ??? Damn, some people.

Tenant- Overflowing it is, it's disgusting. 


Me- Let's get this sorted for you. Where do you live?


Tenant- This is the third time this has happened, you ought to do something about it!


Me- I can certainly send a plumber over. What's your address?


Tenant- chunters on about how appalling it is that no one cares about them, and they'll go to the papers *still without giving address*


Me- Right, I can do that, but I need to know where to send the workman to.


Tenant- So this afternoon then? I will expect you within the hour. HANGS UP


Me- *inserts pen into ear*~~I once managed to get around someone asking for a supervisor for the really mundane reason that someone hadnt put reward points on their card by telling them that the supervisor needed certain information from their receipt. Once I had that, I added their points, credited them the standard amount of points as an apology and let them know that Id done it, their response was Wait, you can do that?! I had to stop myself screaming YES, THATS NINETY PERCENT OF MY JOB!~~I keep having chats like this:

Me: hi its me, can I have the account number

Customer: hello

Customer:  my name is sue.

Me:  how can I help today?

Customer:  I have an account.

Me:  may I have the account number?

Customer:  the account has a problem 

Me:  Ill be happy to take a look, may I have the account number?

Customer:  do you think the problem is because of this thing?

Me:  Ill be happy to look if youll give me the account number.

Customer:  boy, you guys sure do have long hold times 


I AM GETTING MULTIPLE CHATS LIKE THIS A DAY, ITS MAKING ME MURDEROUS~~I worked as a chat advisor in an education settings and I so much feel ALL of this. Similar to providing a name/phone number, I'd have students chat in to ask questions about their account but REFUSED to give me any identifying information to pull it up. I'm sorry you feel uncomfortable providing that information, I can assure your, our chat lines are secure. Then get mad at me when I tell them they have to call in then, if they won't provide me with information. ""Well I don't have time to call, why can't you help me?"". Rinse and repeat. Just maddening.~~I know your pain. I hate when they say ""it's not working"". What's not working!? There's a ton of things that could not be working, your brain the first of all. And worse than that, when they don't even know what kind of devices they have, I'll always remember when one customer told me she had an apple Android S7~~I work in a Healthcare org call center. So many people will give me their life story first.  

When it's always a need of first and last name, birthday and address to pull them up.  

Some days it's painful. I'll ask their name and get a first name, then have to ask for their last name. I'm sorry Jane Doe but there are hundreds of thousands of Janes in our system. That does not help me.~~Whoever created the credo of ""the customer is always right"" is responsible for all of the bullshit that we are dealing with today and I think is also responsible for the rise of ""the Karen's.""  That one simple statement opened up a Pandora's box of problems across all areas of businesses.  Ugh!~~These are my favorite lol. Any time one of my agents escalates someone to me so I can tell them the same thing they've already been told, I give them one repetition before I hit em with the ""The answer is not going to change if you keep asking. There isn't a magic number of times you can ask that makes the answer change. The rules/prices are the rules/prices.""~~Every single quality monitor I get, they take points off because I'm not ""conversational and engaging"" enough. I'm polite and friendly enough (providing they're not being jerks to me, but that's another story), I just don't lile to drive handle time up by engaging in meaningless chitchat. I think it's a stupid thing to even score, since it can change depending on who is grading the call. I've pretty much resigned myself to never expecting to get full points anymore.~~How very dare you not give me the information I want when I'm deliberately obstructing you in finding that information. 

We have customers do this all the time. 

Can I take the last four numbers of your account number?
No you might be a scam. I just want to know if the money has arrived. 

Lady you rang us!~~Reminds me of my first supervisor. I was trying to help a man fix his phone and he was getting pissy because he thought I didnt know what I was talking about because Im a woman. 

My supervisor was listening in on the conversation from his desk, walks up over to me, then hangs up on the customer! He goes back to his desk and types up a note that if the customer calls back again he is to be warm transferred straight to him (my supervisor). 

The guy called back within the hour and my supervisor told him how it was rude to assume someones knowledge based on their gender and that he obviously didnt know something and was calling for help and needed to humble himself.~~I had a call center rep who asked me if my questions had been answered and I typed no.  He asked if he could do more for me and I typed yes and was beginning to tell him what I needed when he said since there was nothing else he was terminating the chat.  I about lost it there.  I had to wait in que again and hoped I would get someone else.  I did and my problem was solved.  I told the new person that I really hoped they would wait for me to finish telling them the problem before closing the chat!~~Some people shouldn't have access to a computer. I took a call yesterday that went like this. 

Me: ""Okay, on this page you should see ""registered customer"" and ""join now"". Go ahead and click on ""join now"", please."" 

Them: ""It says ""registered customer"", do I click that?""
 
Me, while dying a little on the inside: ""No, just to the right of that should be the words ""join now"" on a red banner. Click that one for me, please."" ~~I once had a very irate man demand to be taken off of our marketing list. When I asked for his phone number to pull his account up and update his preferences, he got even more angry and disconnected the call, without providing any type of contact information. 

People, man.~~Yeah its always that response with things.  I have the same response with people at my job when their power gets turned off. Cant you just flip a switch and turn my power on?    
Or you find my house easily when you want to turn me off but now you want to take your time when it comes to turning me back on.~~That happens on the phone too. We have retail locations. Sometimes when a customer is trying to reach the retail location and get the call center they get upset and ask for a real human being. He probably realized you were not a bot and thinks center workers are not people. ~~Every single time I've used chat as a customer I've gotten frustrated as the agent doesn't read what I've written or gives me the same answer multiple times when I've already said I've done that or it doesn't work etc.
Seriously why is it so hard to skip part of the script? I do it all the time, it's not hard.

I've also had customers just lie then deny it. Love screenshot during those times.~~I answer phones and I often get this question. I have ""phone voice"" and apparently sound like a cheerful robot.

""Hello, thank you so much for calling &lt;employer&gt;! My name is Lily_May! How are you doing today?""

And there's this long pause, and then they're like, ""I...I don't...are you a person? Is this real?""

I always assure them I AM a person. But what I really want to say is, ""Yes! I am one of your fellow hoo-mans cover in skin"" in the worst Siri robot voice I can.

""I'm sorry M'am, having measures in place to prevent fraud is not fraud.""~~This infuriates me so much. I have 6 hours to go, but I just can't anymore. I also work chat right now and just had this converstion

C: ""Hi, I have some quesiond about [product]

Me: ""Hi C, I help you with those questions! What would you like to know?""

C: ""Don't address me as C.""

Me: ""I am sorry, miss [last name]. What can I help you with?""

C: ""Don't give me that attitude, is there anyone else that can help me?""
(1 second later) ""Hellloooooo????""

Can I go home already?~~Oh, man. I have absolutely no problems with tech illiterate people, but tech illiterate people who are also completely unreasonable and/or think they know better than you are the absolute worst thing.  
  
If you tell me you don't remember your password, or e-mail, or recovery e-mail, or account name, I'll grin and try to help you. If you then proceed to act like it's completely irrational that someone without *any* of your data cannot access your device, or like I'm the asshole because you pulled the digital equivalent of literally forgetting your name, I'm going to do whatever I can to get rid of you as quickly as possible.~~I've never been phone support^^thank ^^fuck (or official got-paid-for-it tech support), but I just don't understand people who are not only rude but downright abusive to the support personnel with whom they're interacting. 

I mean, quite apart from the fact that it's bloody counterproductive to the customer's ends (they called/chatted in first, it wasn't like the support guy/gal went looking for them), is basic human decency too much to fucking ask????

I couldn't do what you guys &amp; gals do if you paid me. So on behalf of customers everywhere, I'd like to say ""Thank you"" to all of you (and on behalf of the todgers, ""Sorry!""). ~~Youre not just whining, you have a real and valid concern.

I just left my docs office and Im REALLY unhappy with that visit. But no doctor is getting their livelihood threatened Bc they come in 2% low on one survey question.

This is elitist bullshit and you shouldnt have to worry about this. Im sorry you do.~~I like chat support because I can more easily multi task while waiting for an answer. When you support on chat, are you stuck on one chat, or can you multi task too for folks like me? Ive always hoped that you could have 2 chats open too so that you can get things done in between my luls just like I do waiting for your responses. 

As for the life story when you ask for a name bit, Ive probably been guilty of that sometimes. But Ive got the whole thing typed out already just waiting for someone to come on the chat that I can hit send to.~~I get that a lot ... on the phone! 

A downside of having done this for so long (nearly 25 years. Eeeeek!) is you get the greeting and tone down sooooo well it sounds pre-recorded. So a frequent call is; 

Me; hello! This is takemusu. How can I help you today? 

Customer: TECH SUPPORT! 

Me; I can help you with that. To whom am I speaking? 

Customer; TECH SUPPORT! 

Me; you've reached the right spot and I can definitely help you. Are you calling about phone number 123-456-7890? 

Customer; NO!!! DAMN IT beep beep beep beep beep beep beeeeeeep (dials it in the key pad.)

Me; laughing I'm sorry. I don't understand touch tones. What the number you're calling about?

Cust; you, you're, you're a person??????

Me; yes I'm an actual person not the nlike yourself. ~~Love it when I get those chats. I can cover my own ass because they asked for the phone number, but it's one less major problem I have to tackle in my day. Sometimes I'll even offer to assist several times, and they are dead set on calling so, byeeeee!~~I get stuff like that at my job.  
Usually truck drivers who can't comprehend that their GPS is wrong and they are not allowed onsite without an appointment with us.  
Nothing more ""crushing faith in humanity"" than a grown man driving a truck throwing a full tantrum all because the answer hasn't changed.   
And not only hasn't changed but gotten more verbally forceful when they go from the entrance to the exit because they believe they'll speak to someone else and magically the answer will change.~~I play Eve Online. There's a rookie help chat channel where people are automatically enrolled for the first 30 days. I can't tell you how many people go in there and lead with ""can I get some help? I'm new!"" Or, ""how do I play this game, I don't want to do the tutorial, I just want to shoot ships"". Or, my personal favorite ""help"" ""me"" ""please"" on different lines.

Unlike you, I don't have to keep the snark from my replies as I'm not an employee, just a player.~~I work for an emergency comms company (online messaging platform) and I see similar things to this so often it's crazy. I had one guy copy and paste a 3 page document from work in to an SMS box and send it to 1000 recepients... he then phoned us in a panic to try and stop the message. Our response was ""We're an EMERGENCY communications company with top of the range SMS dispatchers - these messages will have already been received"". You could hear the panic in his voice... He didn't work for that particular company for very long after~~So, she had a phone that she ""accidentally"" locked herself out of and suddenly couldn't recall her own ID or password, *and* also didn't even know the email she herself would have had to provide as the security backup? Yeah, that sounds super legit... I'm sure she wasn't *actually* a thief that either stole someone else's phone, or an angry ""partner"" trying to spy on her SO.~~15-20 years ago, it was easy to find the phone number for a company on their website. It was just right there on the home page. Now many companies (doesn't sound yours is one of those) really do make it difficult to just find the phone number. Like having to click 3-4 times to get the phone number (and if you press the incorrect number of clicks, you won't get the number). Amazon used to be really bad at this, but they've made it easier in recent years to get a phone number. I realize they are trying to funnel people to FAQs or other online resources, but sometimes you just have to talk to a person.~~I had many customers complaint about an issue of not be able to send mms pic, so as a creative I'm I told them to use apps over text like (whatsapp, signal, etc). They were be like ""but I like using mms"". Me: ""Sir, there is a problem with the towers which is affecting the mms, you can wait until is fixed or use the suggestion given.

Cust: But cant you fix it?
Me: No I cant, this is an offshore company, I am not close to the tower and I'm not an engineer. Do you need any else?~~I don't understand why metrics can't be changed.  Obviously there is an issue, criminals are hitting you harder than Barry Bonds hitting a baseball, but yet management won't take this into account.  Either your management doesn't care about you, or are absolutely clueless about what happens on the floor.

Either way, good on you for getting out of there and into a better position.~~When I worked for Major Monopoly US Cable provider I did chat support, and we were required to run 2, sometimes 3 chat windows at a time. I used to love those ones because it made it easy to take care of the people who actually had real responses because we had hotkeys. You'd type in the word ""real"" in the text window, press enter, and then ""I am a real person"" would show up in the chat. I'd just keep throwng that in every now and again with a ""really"" for ""I really am a real person"" for good measure. ~~I do retail phones. When people tell me ""I'll never shop here again, and I'll tell all of my friends to do the same!"" Because I only have 5 minutes per call, and 0 F***s to give, I always respond ""Well, I'm very sorry to hear it. Anything else I can help you with then?"" Omg they go ape sh!t when I don't give them every demand. Like, look... You're threatening to take away your $40 every few months you shop with us? Considering we're a multi million dollar company, I think we'll survive with you taking &lt;$250 a year over to Target or whatever.~~From what I have seen, you must be much better at multi tasking with chat support, because you will be asked to provide support to multiple people at the same time. This means you have to be able to think about different tasks at the same time, keep chats separated, and all that fun stuff.

Either way, you are going to be doing just same stuff, different way. Get an ergonomic keyboard, probably really want a second monitor for text chat, and make sure that you can type fast enough to really get through what needs to be done.

Oh, one more annoying thing, get ready to chat with people who cannot type, use l33t speak all the time, and who take forever to respond because they take forever to type.~~","The commenter works at a call center that handles 90% of their business during the holiday season.

16.0,"Recently, I had a customer escalate to a supervisor at least two times (that I know of), because he said we were lying to him that the only way we could access the acct was with the last four SSN of the acct holder. I'm sorry but I'm not going to just give you unauthorized access and then lose my job because of it.~~The opposite of this: the people that spend 10 minutes explaining what their peoblem is before you can pull up their account. Then they have to tell you all over again because they made no sense without context.

You've got 5 years of history and 300 invoices how the hell am i supposed to know what invoice you're talking about?! 

God bless those that get on the line and say, hello I need to talk about my account, the number is 12345.~~I asked someone to verify the answer to their security question during a call and they yelled that they were *not* giving me that information so I could just, steal their identity. I let them know that I already knew the answer, as I could see it on their account.. like seriously people~~Had this user call in this one time, about some issue that needed troubleshooting. But she didn't want troubleshooto, she just wanted it fixed.

The more I tried to tell her that in orderto fix the issue I needed tk troubleshoot first, the more she said just fix it cos she was too busy for me to troubleshoot.

Another user called in to say that her resolution and scaling was not how it was before, couldn't help her cos she couldn't tell me how it was, just that its ""broken"".

Apparently they dont like being told they can't be helped if they don't tell us what is wrong first.~~So, I work in a Call Center that deals with Customer Service via Phone Calls, Emails, and Chat.   


As both a former Chat Agent and the current trainer for new hires, my number 1 rule to my people is ""Assume that customers don't/didn't read anything"" Not the emails the get, not the product information, nothing. 80% of our complaints could probably be resolved if customers simply read what's in front of them.  


The funny thing about your ""favorite"" is that 90% of the time I'm already looking at your personal information dude, I just need you to confirm it either to make sure I've got the right account pulled up or so that I know where something's going. If I ***really*** wanted to steal it, I could, and very easily.

I feel your pain, all of it, wholeheartedly.~~YoU could Be More EmPaThEtIc 

How about we treat grown-ups like non children? If they are unhappy with a product then they can move onto another companies item.

Don't like your cable/TV company? Cool but I'm not here to empathize im here to help you fix it. Yes yes I dont care for the company either(even though they made GREAT strides in the past few years to not be so annoying). You are free to cancel our service which is not contract, and go back onto a contract with one of the many other companies around here. Have fun spending 2 years at minimum. 

Fuck empathy. I've had enough. 

Still salty from when I worked for a major isp as video support. Super crap pay, and so many people don't understand the basics of this tv thing that's been around for 50+ years.~~I never had a problem with people swearing as part of their regular conversation. Unless they were calling me names, its just words. 

Id often adapt to their manner of speaking if the situation warranted, since many customers took offense to someone being formal on the phone. If they were speaking in conversational slang, and I spoke in proper English, theyd complain that I was taking down to them. It was just easier to meet them where they were. ~~I've seen this before though.  You say that she didn't get her order in correctly so you were offering her a refund.  What else are you supposed to do, right?  The fact that you didn't show enough contrition (sarcasm) when she didn't get her order and acted like it was no problem just to refund her is what set her off.  She wanted you to beg and plead for her not to cancel the order and when you didn't, she was determined to be a pain in the ass to you, because obviously cancelling her order didn't seem to bother you.

Games people play.....~~At one center, a guy offered to fly one of our female agents to Atlanta to ""meet."" She was smart enough to tell him ""no.""

Another one had a lady trying to unload her daughter on male staff.  Good luck with that.  If you can't handle her, we don't want her.~~Well at least they cant blame your company now if their phone DOES explode while in their hand. 

You clearly warned them and they clearly didnt care. Plus since its on chat those are logged so they cant say you didn't warn them. All legal would have to do is pull the chat logs.~~&gt;maybe the store will know 

Lololololololololol unless its a speciality store, then no. You take a product back to Walmart, or even best buy, NO ONE is gonna know how to fix it *unless* they possibly had that issue themselves. They are so gonna likely ask if you called the support team and you'd respond ""well I did and they were going to escalate it so I brought it here instead"" and they'll give you a weird look like you just set your car on fire cause the radio was busted.~~Live chatter here.  As long as the company gives you the tools to authenticate, it has benefits.  

A few things I've learned:

Customers don't read, just like they don't listen.

They (customers) can be jerks, just like they can be sweet.   This is a reflection of them, not your medium. 

Stay true to yourself.   Let their personality be allowed to shine in their writing.   Personalized canned responses.   As long as the information is accurate,  they should be allowed to be human.  

My favorite: all days snacks.   Can eat and type.... not to worry about manners.

Light hearted: all days snacks.  Temptation was great.  So are my hips now. 

Prepare the staff,  communicate.   There will be issues.   It won't be perfect right out of the gate.  As long as you don't dilute the truth,  as a chatter, we are much more forgiving.   
~~Tell your dad buddy to stop caring about scammers and start sending free video cards to every scamming asshole who asks for one. If his company different care enough to stop it why should he ?

Keeping your job in this case should be more important than doing the right thing for a faceless corporation that just wanted to use you up.~~Buddy was upset that I wouldn't document his friends account because he missed the deadline to pay  the friends bill on time.  He told me ""your mom went somewhere and had sex, then she had you.""  To which I replied ""You are correct sir.  My mother did go somewhere to have sex before she gave birth to me"".~~The spelling itself is horrendous, not to mention the content. What sort of sicko has nothing better to do with their time than this crap? I almost want to say it sounds like a messed up kid/teen trying to prank chat, but I don't want to believe a kid would say some of these things. 

I wish you could IP block him though. He can still call or come in to purchase, and you shouldn't have to deal with this sort of abuse. And if it is a kid, I bet the parents would be pretty pissed that their child's disgusting prank chatting got their IP address banned.~~Why do people think they can do these sorts of things via chat? I have customers like this too (not high end auto) but they think they can literally open a whole new account with no money up front and verify everything via text, and no. And will then try to dispute old accounts as well (because we will then collect on those as well). Like, no. You can't prove much through text alone. Much less when you're using the same cell phone you've used on your 40 old accounts that you never paid us for. But they keep trying acting like we're rude and hate them. No we just want paid for what you used, and want you to stop lying. Just pay your bills.~~Those are clear mental cases.

When I was working with Hell Canada, was normal to have some customers calling thousands times per year for the most asinine reasons. 

The champion was somebody with three thousands calls in one year. Nope, I am not exaggerating. The guy was completely loco, but nice on the phone.~~First off, it is an empty threat....because they don't realize how idiotically ridiculous they sound but in their feeble little mind they think they sound as smart as a rocket scientist. 

You are REALLY going to involve a lawyer, pay more money, and have it all drag out because you don't want to verify anymore HIPPA information when you can easily just do so and have your question answered right away?

Newsflash to the people that do this: you are not hurting the call center reps when you do this because they are just going to look at you at the damn fool that you are and take the next call which is probably someone who actually wants to be helped!~~I once talked to Sinead O'Connor about some info on her stock certificate being converted into digital ones. 

Another was Jaime Fox about a mutual fund he never knew he had. It was worth 7 digits now and he didnt even know. 

Paris Hilton is somebody we talked to a lot, as we were the virtual doorman company at one of her apartments in NYC. She frequently forgets her fob and/or her phone is dead so she needs to call us to gain access to her own building. We have camera on these calls so its for sure her. 

None of these people were rude to me or my team. But maybe because we didnt really made a big deal that we were talking to them.~~I preferred chat because you can see what they are typing and can prepare your answers/get links in advance. Also, people don't need you to repeat yourself (though some idiots don't like scrolling up) and my favorite part is you can talk to people and surf the web while you do it.

The downside is I had up to 3 chats at a time, so if all three are needy it is way more work than the phones. You can't place them on hold. Non-native (or uneducated) English typers can be HARD to understand and asking them to rephrase can be seen as a lot more condescending then asking someone on the phone to repeat them self.

I had the option to go back to phones many times and didn't even consider it.~~&gt;Dumbfucks that give me their full credit card info.

I used to do this when I was working in retail.  Customer gives me their card

PtG: Cheque, Savings, or Credit?

Cust: Savings.

PtG: Any cash out?

Cust: No thanks.

PtG: And your PIN?

Cust: *often would start reciting their pin*

PtG: You don't want to give that to me sir/madam~~",The commenter had a customer escalate to a supervisor because they were lying about the only way they could access their account.

16.0,"I've been called a lot of names since moving to night shift. Its quite funny though to me. I work as an unlicensed insurance rep. I am a glorified billing department basicly. So when people have missed their payment and their policy is canceled I can take payment but can not garentee reinstatement because I'm unlicensed. The replies range from ""why chu gotta be a bitch bout it?can't chu just restate my surance"" to screaming indistinctly with the only understandable words being slut, cunt, job, suck a cock whore, bend me over, and repeatedly fucked by whores like me in between 4-5 minutes of straight yelling like a howler monkey between each ""insult"". (followed by over the top bubbliness asking if he wanted to make that payment now)~~It pains me to write this - everyone on here knows I hate stupid customers *but* I don't really see what the customer did wrong here... I mean this *really* pisses me off with some companies (obviously not sure how your company works) but there's nothing more annoying than a live chat option/window popping up and then being told ""sorry I can't do that"" (or whatever) as I'm only for sales - that *really* annoys me.

Maybe I misunderstood your post but the customer seemed reasonable and accepting that you couldn't help... not sure why you thought you where being trolled? (Apart from the odd choice of password!).~~I had someone convinced I was a robot. They asked me about 4 times while I was verifying their information. Didn't get anywhere because they still couldn't believe I was a human. Even stuttered over my words trying to think of something to say to convince them I could help. They insisted I transfer them to a supervisor. Really pissed me off.~~On the other hand though, I've had chat agents taking forever to answer me. I'll get connected and then silence.... Until I say hello? 

I make sure to include all the necessary information right away, and they only reply ""sure, i'll be able to help with that"" and then silence again.... Until I ask ""so?"" And it keeps going on like that the whole conversation~~Sounds like the guy who called in yesterday to complain that he has done the math three times and there is $170 missing from his account. I had to sit there and literally add up every purchase (which he can easily see on the app or website) to show that actually the math checks out and he finally hung up after I did it twice and he still insisted I was wrong ~~I am not call center, but will help out our reception staff with problem patients. Had a guy the other day going on about how awful we were because we didnt deliver his equipment. We didnt deliver because he was in the hospital at the time and needed to wait until he was discharged. Finally tells me he never wants to do business with us again and to never call him again. I let him know that we will close his chart and I will let the team no he no longer wants the equipment. You could tell he wanted me to bed with him to stay, our something. Since I wasnt about to do that he instead told me to bite him and hung up.~~I recently disputed my QA score because they said CCS should have documented that they transferred the caller to XYZ. I checked my task notes on the call and my very last sentence was CCS transferred member to XYZ for assistance with her (insert reason here). The denied my dispute &amp; Im stuck with 80% for absolutely no reason. I think Ive decided to just stop looking at the scores.~~Look at it as a time saver.  You didn't have to argue with them for 15 minutes before the call ended.

Some folks will only accept the magic wand fix.  Wave it and all now works.  

Mine is in the shop, so if you don't want to let me help you the old fashioned way, I will wish you a pleasant day and go on my way.~~I used to work for american express and one time talked to Sugar Ray Leonard and his wife. His wife called and in order to give her all the info I had to talk to him, so she put him on the phone. I asked her if her husband was the boxer and she got really annoyed and was rude to me. I know it was unprofessional of me but I was excited. Ive not watched a sugar ray video since.~~Not me, but my professor at uni had a good story about famous people: While doing a randomized survey calling people on their mobile phones, the random numbers generator managed to spit out Angela Merkels number. Quite an awkward call and apparently led to a hard rule that politicans need a phone number with a different amount of digits to avoid random calls.~~Worked as customer support for a cellular provider here in Canada.

Actually had a customer call in and demand I unsend a text message he sent. When I said I couldn't do that, he started shouting at me about how I just don't want to help him. He then threatened to cancel his services and demanded to speak to a supervisor.

Passed it on to a supervisor, don't know how it turned out, just glad I didn't have to deal with his yelling anymore.~~I'm a business student a large Midwestern college. I have a professor in a 400 level class that loves to show students how to ""Screw Companies"" I've learned more about how to complain to a company and  get free shit than what i am paying for. I agree, we should stop throwing discounts at customers~~I work for a health insurance company and I feel this pain too.  Sometimes it's like pulling teeth to get someone to say what exactly they want. 
They ask about ""my claim"". Well, which one? I can see every single one you've ever made and there's 3 in process right now. 
They ask about ""how much is left of my benefits?"" WHICH ONE? Every type of benefit has a separate amount! 
Worst of all, people who call and don't even know what they're trying to ask. ""Uh well there's a thing and my wife asked me to call and ask about it but I don't know what it is."" :|
Makes me want to yank my hair out.~~I feel this deeply in my soul, and this goes for oral communication, too. Special shout-out to folks who throw tantrums when Ive asked for them to give me, say, their email address and the conversation proceeds like this:

Hmm. Im sorry, Im not finding that. Do you perhaps have another email address with us?
No, its johndoe123@aol.com. I told you that. I dont have another email address.

Supervisor? good luck.~~i work in the retail store equivalent of probably the same company as you and i get that well i might as well throw it in the bin line ALL the time when customers have put themselves into account/device lock positions like this and it really is the most immature response to a situation you could get, they take absolutely NO responsibility for their own accounts/devices/passwords etc. and choose to take it out on you since they feel inadequate. i think your response was absolutely appropriate and, as you said, your job is to resolve technical issues and do so with empathy, where appropriate. how on earth would they expect you to show empathy for a toddler temper tantrum like that.~~Surprised they let you have 100%.

The QA at my old callcenter capped out at 80%.  If you did everything perfect, it was 80%.  You had to go ""above and beyond"" to hit 80+.  

It was at the QA's discretion.

That means if you were part of the clique, or had been flagged for special treatment, you could get a good score.  If not, the BEST you could do was a solid B-.

That was the last time I cared about QA scores at all.~~My coachings are ALWAYSSS about being more empathetic. They always get mad cause when the. customer gets mad Im not empathetic.. enough. Like Im sorry but when I get a dstat and its cause of POLICY that doesnt have shit to do with me they never want to change it. Even if you did good so I really dont try as hard anymore. Its not worth it when youre literally getting coached because theyre not happy about something that you literally cannot do.~~&gt; no thank you

Well then I'm sorry ma'am but I'm unable to offer you any assistance as I can't locate your account. HAVE A GREAT DAY.

Seriously people like this waste so much time unnecessarily - I hope that survey gets removed or dosent count against you in anyway.~~I dont know your situation but you only get one life. I was in a job that made me feel this way for four years. It made me feel miserable and it changed my personality. For what? So a company can just make way more money off your labor than you are. I had written and deleted probably 5 resignation letters over the course of that job and fantasized about walking out every other day. One day I actually did it. Best decision of my lifebecause I took my life BACK. It might seem daunting, but at a point you just have to ask yourself if all this work is even taking you anywhere you want to be. ~~I usually prefer chats, but last night actually, I was chatting with Verizon customer service, and noticed that I was hearing sounds (the pop sound or whatever) as though the agent replied, but couldnt see a thing on my end. Then the chat was ended. I logged back in today to chat without issue; I think sometimes (often? the software is just extremely buggy. Sometimes it will refuse to allow me to hit send, sometimes I see massive delays in agents messages coming through.~~I love chat customer service. It is so convenient. 

I think the first problem -customers stating their problems first -is because the chat robot that we encounter initially / first asks what is your problem.

It might still be hell, but at least it'd be a fresh hell.~~You can get wraps for your hands at any pharmacy or online. I have ones called Hand-eze. 

Chat support is great for people who have been on phones first. You get experience doing another line of business, its less stress, and customers are generally more technologically savvy. 

As far as troubleshooting, you are usually limited in things you can do. A lot of it is referring to support via phone for more complicated issues. 

Source: I work higher up in a call center. Feel free to message me if you need also. ~~Number 1 is my personal pet peave. 

In my chat greeting, aside from the welcome, is a request that before we proceed,  I need specific information.  Name, phone number and last four of the account.  Quite simple really.

Do you think I am provided with it?  No. 

 I get the reason for the chat (useless until I get your info, since I don't know if I can even help yet).

 I get a rant, in multiple lines, about my voice counter parts.

 I get a hi.   And then.. nothing.  No sign that the Visitor is typing.  Just.. hi. 

Or, my personal fav:   ?  

But.... at least no one yells at me. I can disconnect and ban for use of foul and inappropriate language, I can be sweet as honey and bend a few rules, but I can be cold as ice.~~Somebody was once insulting me, and I told them that there was no need for that and to please not curse.

""What, are you some sort of a fag?""

...dude, I've known plenty of homosexual folks, and many of them are more likely to curse than I am. And I curse like an idiot who read new sentence enhancers off a dumpster.~~Best insult I had was when I worked for Fruit Phone support.

Some guy's phone wasn't working and needed replacing. He decided the best way to get this sorted was at Fruit Store. 

When I advised him he needed to book an appointment and none were available until the next day, he LOST HIS SHIT.

He then threw this AMAZING insult at me.

""You Sir are a pompous bent TWAT""

Muted - Laughed - Coach laughed. Good time had by all. Apart from the muted customer &gt;=)~~I can understand exactly how you feel, I've had similar (though not quite so abusive) language hurled at me over the last few months since starting my phone support job. I've literally had people ask to be put through to a financial advisor at our company (assuming that they're all guys, only 2 of them are) because 'he will make more sense about my pension, you're just the phone girl'. 

Good for you not backing down though. If it helps, he's probably just going to get frustrated trying to get it sorted and give up even trying after a while so in theory he might never get in touch again *hopefully*~~You had more patience than I would have. It would have been something like this from me "" You declined the offer when it was offered free it is now a paid offer. If you want it is $X per month. If she screamed about it being free I'd simply say ""Again as you mentioned you declined during the free period you will not be getting it free if you want it I have given you pricing.""
'
Any more ranting I'd simply say ""I gave you your options you seem to wish neither one so if there is nothing further I'll ending  the chat""

Then end the chat before she can respond.~~The exact opposite is what Im generally used to as a customer using the click to chat option for most businesses. Ive only ever gotten useful help once out of the 10 times Ive tried as the CSRs on the other end of the chat tend to make as much sense as the client here.  Oy vey. Do you know if the guy ever got the help he needed?~~I get these all the time. We have one client who does not allow people from other countries to buy from the US website (we have global sites) and then ship out of the country. Which means we get tons of people from eastern Europe and Asia chatting in trying to translate their own messages and my replies. It's usually a really crappy time.~~IP's will be dynamic so blocking him today won't block him tomorrow, but may block a legit customer tomorrow. With un-authenticated chat services this is basically a big issue, one we deal with at work for clients (as webchat is one of the many forms of interaction available). No easy answers to blocking either. ~~That's the fun part with written language: the tone is highly subjective. 

Your answers could definitely be read as jerky - but just because that's the case with nearly any written word. In her case she read it like that because *she* would be using that tone  - she was basically projecting hard enough to work at a movie theater.

Edit to clarify: I don't think you where snarky. It reads like a perfect professional interaction to me!  But text based interactions always can be read with a ""tone"" and she did it, because she herself is snarky and would react that way to someone having that question.~~We are empowered at my job to do what needs to be done and I don't mind giving discounts for an issue. It's what I would expect as a customer. The thing is you need to be sure it isn't a bigger issue first or else you end up with this situation where the discount just keeps snowballing into even more money off because no one stopped to get a solution first. Next thing you know we're at 25-30% off and the item is actually out of stock and the order needs to be cancelled. Then the customer is going to want to reorder and expect that same pricing on the new item. Sure its not my money so whatever, but have a little forethought.~~Fair enough but from the customer point of view it frequently asks you to enter name , account number and question only for that to be asked by the rep as soon as you are connected. Very irritating, just let me join the que if they don't see my info anyway~~So not quite the same but I schedule medical appointments. The ones I love are the ones that don't want to answer questions about COVID exposure, which we are required to ask before scheduling in-person visits for obvious reasons. Y'all, I can literally see every medical appointment you've made for the last 20 years, but you don't want to tell me if you have been knowingly exposed to someone with COVID? Okay, well your ""privacy"" is not worth the safety of our staff. (This is only if they want to be seen in person, we do have remote visit options as well if they don't want to answer.)~~I spent years on the phones myself.   When I have to call for support of any sort, I do my best\* to be calm and reasonable.     For I know you much better service with honey, than with vinegar.  


  
\* I had one company that was fully into the cycle of schedule a tech, confirm the appointment, no show, no record of appointment.~~Makes sense to me, also sounds familiar to other popular phrases like ""blood is thicker than water"" as if it meant you should stay with crappy family just because.

Older folks think loyalty to a company nowadays means they get to be more entitled, I dont recall many ""reward"" programs that allow the customer to be an asshole.~~*cough cough* this totally sounds like someones phone was locked by FMIP hahahaha yeah thats never fun to try to fix, and if Im right... I know which company this is... and I worked for a third party company that did calls for them as well. Phones locked for that reason was such a pain, and a guaranteed fail on the call if a QA caught wind of it. Just like when 2FA was rolled out. That was a pain as well.~~Ive had two brushes with fame in a call center environment. One was Bob Barker, very nice fellow on the phone by the way, but the tech prior to me broke policy and made a personal commitment to follow up with him which was a no no because the call was escalated to my queue and we dont do personal commitments either way (this was a cell phone provider back in 2010) and the other brush with fame or better worded as infamy was Shirley Phelps Roper of the Westboro Baptist Church, she was every bit as pleasant as one would expect and I believe her account was flagged for a special group to handle. She technically wasnt even allowed to speak with me if I remember correctly. She was a real peach.~~yep. i get it all the time.

'all right and is your card lost or is it stolen?' 

'yes.' ......

or when i ask a merchant how they received the customer's card number: 'ok and how did you receive that card number? was it online or over the phone for example?' 'yes' .....~~Did chat/email for about five years. Multitasking in my case was working an e,mail while waiting for the guests response. I have a nice ergonomic keyboard so no hand problems. People that don't speak English or a language we support by phone tend to chat and use google translate. Very hard to decipher sometimes. I've moved on to agent support.~~","The commenter sympathizes with the customer who lost their keys and notes that it's not the customer's fault if they don't know their own information for their device. They also mention that their company only requires two details when giving out order information, and that the customer's behavior"
16.0,"**PLEASE** reformat this. The fixed monotype font will run wide until the end of each line, and not wrap, so it truncates on smaller screens (like mobile) and can't be read. 

If it isn't reformatted to a regular font, I can't read it, and I honestly can't be the only person in that situation. 

Hope this comment helps not just you, but many  others in future :) ~~Since it's a Sunday, packages aren't delivered by USPS or UPS.  (Not sure if FedEx offers that service.  I think they do but it's a premium service; most purchasers aren't going to pay for it.)

So not only did they wait until DAY OF to call, they also waited until the one day when you *know* it's not going to be delivered.  (And you know full well it's sitting in the depot waiting for Monday to be delivered.)~~I am glad our chat ratings aren't looked at ever either because they are wildly inaccurate. One time, I took a chat and then the local intranet in the office broke, so I couldn't reply back anymore. I was so annoyed because she rated me badly, but I literally couldn't type back to let her know. Other times, the program has issues with a large amount of text or with copy/pasted text and people get mad when we ask them to retype in smaller amounts.~~When I did support for a company which made game controllers and sound cards for Windows computers (kinda tells you how long ago this was), we were bought by a big corporation which decided that they were going to stop making/supporting sound cards - but our support department was specifically told that we COULD NOT MENTION THIS to customers, even if asked directly.

I found a loophole - the parent company's support staff were under no such rule and had been telling anyone who asked what was going on, so if I was asked if the rumours about sound cards were true I replied that I was just a poor front line grunt who wasn't kept up to date on what the big bosses had planned, but if the customer called those other support people at the parent company they might have more information than I did.~~OMG. 50% of my calls this evening where this situation right here. Its like pulling teeth from a crocodile. 
Can I have you verify your full property address including your city, state, and zip code? 1234 Rose st. Ok, can I have your city, state and zip code? Uh, mega city. Alright can I have your state and zip code? Yeah its 12345. (Mines banging my head against desk) can I have you state your state? Oh didnt I give that to you? (Eye roll) no sir, oh its CO. Thank you sir.

Jesus Crust people just give me the entire information Im asking for, its not hard.~~See if your chat has a block feature. Ours does. Handy for things just like this. Had a guy from a area we sold six months ago having issues. Keeps coming in saying 'we suck' just starts a chat. Ends it rates it bad and after comments 'we suck'. I blocked him for 999 days (the max) gone now. Also why we don't look at chats that are rated bad most are spam like this or even good conversations lots of customer thank you's and then  a thumbs down grade. We took it out of any kind of scoring because it was so skewed.~~I'm so happy the place I work for doesn't have this chat thing implemented. Everyone that calls us is so batshit insane I don't think we'd be able to successfully serve them via chat.

On the other end of this though, I absolutely hate when I use the chat option and it's the rep I'm chatting with that appears to not read what I want and keeps pushing to sell me this thing I never asked for and I have to repeat: 

Me: Hi I have a problem with X can you fix X for me?
  
Rep: Sure thing! I can also offer you Y for just $5 more.
 
Me: No that's ok thank you.

Rep: But Y i's gonna be a better deal though for just $5 more.

Me: No I don't need Y. I never asked about Y. I just want you to fix my X. That's it. Nothing else.~~If someone gives you their ZIP code, why would you need city and state?  Sounds like a software or policy issue.  Many databases have it set so if you enter ZIP code, it automatically fills in city and state.  Not saying the customer wasn't being an ass, but I can also understand his frustration.~~I got one of those zombies once with a very similar situation, with those you need to use analogies otherwise you will waste your time and your sanity.

Zombie: So you can't help me (like five times)

Me: Let me put it this way. Let's say you got some kind of plumbing issue, I am just an architect, you need a specialist, a plumber; because I care about you, I am referring you to him, we are both working in residential construction, but him have more tools and experience with your situation. Comprende?

Just pray the zombie doesn't have a real plumbing issue, otherwise you just opened a terrible can of worms.~~Had a customer not giving me the details and she said: I was told not to give you my information bc everyone can work there

My dry answer was: info or no assistance. 

How can I help someone with detailed personal matters when I can't look into the files .lol


Other customers are surprised when I have to let them confirm their adresses and other personal details.
""Why is that...you know who iam""
Me: Ehm..no we have more than 1 million customers and everyone could pretend to be YOU.~~Because just like whenever they use the device, they don't think as to what they're doing and just blindly follow instructions and don't apply any common sense.  They've been told not to share information online so they don't.  They've been told to call tech support for issues with the device so they do that.  No one's instructed them that they might have to share information in order to get support.......and they're not used to thinking for themselves so they don't share information.  They don't understand the device in the first place and it makes no sense to them anyway so it seems logical to them that support doesn't make sense either.~~I work roadside assistance for a lot of insurance companies. It is obviously inbound calls. It never ceases to amaze me how people will refuse to give me their policy number, the only way I'm able to locate a member, on a daily basis.

17.0,"I once had an elderly couple calling about their fancy new phone...they were stereotypically clueless but unlike a lot of callers they knew it and that's why they were calling an 'expert'

They put me on speaker and we began...they were the most adorably couple of sweet people I've ever had call me

The call took forever but I didn't mind a bit

My favorite part was when hubby was getting exasperated because he didn't understand something and she said ""Now Bill you apologise to the nice boy(I was 50 at the time) he's doing his best!""

I want to be like them when I grow up!~~It gets easier. My number one pet peeve of all pet peeves is when I'm talking with someone and they decide they want to suddenly interrupt me with one of these: wait wait wait wait WAIT! or a: hey hey! HEY! HEY!! HEYYYYYYY!!!!
  
Someone dropped one of these on me today and before they could get the last bit off *click*. I usually make a quick callback attempt and then disconnect after a ring or two to make it look like it was possibly an error and that I tried to reach them back.~~I love how customers lie all the time. I do tech support and when people have a VPN running it can cause errors. I was working with a guy for 30 minutes and everything he was saying was happening sounded like the VPN errors. I asked him like 4 or 5 times if he had one running, he kept saying no. So I was going to escalate it to our hq. All of a sudden it worked, he said wow I didn't think the VPN would cause issues. I was so pissed, I went home sick for the rest of my shift.~~It reminds me of one call I had while working tech support for kitchen/laundry appliances. The guy I talked to had won the lottery, so he finally bought all new appliances for himself. He told me what hed been doing since he won, and that the best part of winning was being able to help other people. We ended up chatting for at least an hour, about where we were from and things like that. Greatest customer Ive ever had.~~I will admit that I always smile when stuff like that happens. Had a customer named Barbara Gordon and she lived on Batman street. I work with a Batman fanboy and he got a kick out of it too. He then flipped it around and reminded us that our email clients name...is oracle.~~I mean when I say that felt good. It felt GOOD. I had to double post. I'm sure he raged so hard he probably cried. Or punched something. Probably called back and chewed me out!

And the most satisfying part is I followed protocol. And if the call was pulled they can only monitor the part before the conference call transfer. 



So. Yea. ~~So. Many. Stories. 

Whats the phone number for computer chip company in Albuquerque?  (I wasnt located anywhere near NM and clearly worked for an airline)

You sent me to the wrong city. I wanted Portland, ME not Portland, OR. (Sir, you booked this ticket yourself online)

Him: I want to bring my pet on the plane with me. 
Me:  Okay, how big is your dog or cat?  
Him: No, my camel~~&gt;What is an emotional support animal supposed to assist with in the event of an emergency anyway...

For those of us who *actually* have emotional support animals, they don't act in an emergency so much as they prevent a personal emergency. They prevent meltdowns, panic attacks, and other emotional events for people with PTSD, autism or whatever they need help with. I personally have my dogs here in a place that doesn't allow them because I get severe migraine induced mood swings that can cause me to become suicidally depressed  or irrationaly angry in minutes. They intervene and help calm me down.

But yeah, most people get away with taking their pets everywhere by giving legit people a bad rap.~~So the first reservation ""timed out"" with no indication to the customer, and two other reservations went through, again with no indication to the customer, so she booked with another airline which apparently did indicate that it went through.

Other than her abusive demeanor, I'm finding it hard to fault the customer for the airline's 1970's style ticketing practice. It's 2016. There's no reason they can't authorise the card and simultaneously email the customer with at least a ""your reservation is currently in the ticketing process and will be available for review in 5 minutes on the website.""  I'm absolutely certain that if she had only tried the first time and it ""timed out"", and she didn't check back until the next day and prices had gone up that the airline wouldn't honor the lower price. Her frustrations with your airline are entirely valid, in my opinion.~~We're in South Florida, friend posted this to fb earlier today.

""Just got a call from a lady who wanted to know where to get a hotel to wait for her cruise on Sunday in case her hotel near the port is evacuated.

I said it will be. Give us a day or two.

""That was me, I am so sorry I was rude to you!  I was having a bad day, I just found out my husband was having an affair.  I took it out on you, and I'm very sorry!""

She gets her apology, and everyone else gets a giggle.~~I just find it remarkable that in the wake of a catastrophic disaster people are more concerned with very trivial things instead of preserving life and sentimental personal belongings.

The sarcastic laugh that I got all day as I mentioned that I don't have flights until Saturday.

The effort that ppl take to dispute a ""why"" to that response is better spent calling relatives/planning a carpool/acquiring bus or train tickets etc etc...~~When I was on the frontlines in the call center, and I knew the customer was right, but I didn't have the authority to grant whateveritwas, i would say *I* am really sorry, but *I* can't do whatever itwas, with a HUGE emphasis on ""I."" Sometimes they would pick up on it right away, some never did.~~I had some guy call not too long ago so mad before being on call... then gets on yelling I ask what one of our locations he's at and he gives a impossible string of numbers and letters (we don't use letters) and I ask if he's sure that it's one of our locations and bobs your uncle asks for a sup within a minute 30 seconds.~~Talked to an older British gentleman yesterday for an hour and a half. We spoke about art, literature, politics. His travels to Cambodia, Thailand, Australia. His plans to move to Australia to be with his family. My life and family where I live. Just an excellent conversation with a complete stranger. 

I love my job!~~There is a very strange psychological phenomena surrounding the WTC attacks. People who had nothing to do with it created bizarre stories and even based large parts of their life around being ""there"" or relevant to the narrative somehow. There are some very high profile people who have lied about it, and the articles about it are a fascinating read.

Honestly, it's probably a lie. But I could definitely be wrong.~~Ugh, the sex callers  I had a guy who kept asking me for a phone number again because he was mixing up the numbers. I stopped after the third request and, just before I hung up on his gross ass, I heard him in a strained voice say, ""almost there!"" It should be a crime to call a freaking crisis line to get your rocks off.~~I work in medical billing customer service, and wish so badly that I could hang up on patients sometimes when they go off like this. I get that the healthcare system needs an overhaul and that theyre being overcharged but it isnt my fault and I dont deserve to be called a liar or be cursed at. It once took me 15 minutes to get a patient off the phone because she wouldnt stop screaming at me and kept talking over me every time I tried to give her information. ~~""fear mongering as Zika is just a rename of west nile virus""

ok Dr Airline guy... I bet you believe that autism is caused by vaccines and the flouride in the water is for mind control...

Zika and West Nile are similar sure... but then Hep A, B and C are similar... doesnt mean they are interchangeable.~~I got a call once from a woman in DC who had no idea how our call system worked. She kept messing up despite my clear explanations and finally said to someone beside her - this woman is a complete idiot in French (meaning me). I was thinking- bitch you're calling Canada. Flipped over, finished her call in French. All she could manage was uhh...um....um.... 

It was so great~~its ok, i got asked why i need to ask for someone's postcode today, to make it worse they literally had one of the most generic and common surnames ever . (smith)  


they proceeded to tell me i need to know their details as they call all the time.  


there is roughly 2000 agents on the phone and each of us take upwards of 100 calls a day so no i don't know your fucking details you idiot  


they then got angry i asked for DOB, you literally cant win with some of them~~I work for a cable company and have almost the same conversation every day

Me: Ok so the next available appointment to have a tech out is tomorrow between 3 and 5.

Customer: Is there anything in the morning tomorrow?

Me: No I'm sorry 3-5 is the only appointment tomorrow. I have an 8-10 the next day if you'd like that one.

Customer: No that doesn't work for me. So you have something around noon tomorrow?

Me:....no.~~so she got sent an email confirmation of the transaction, so she knew it had gone through, and ignored it? 

She shouldn't really have to install a banking application, and check it, to see if a payment went through. 

She should immediately receive a confirmation mail, or even a confirmation on a page saying the order had been placed, like pretty much all other online sales sites. 

I'm sorry, I don't see the funny side to this. I see an upset customer, trying to use an obviously bad website, getting screwed over by support who don't want to help. ~~I work for another travel company, different industry, and I have people try to claim the website is going to offer a better deal all the time and I absolutely love it when I say that I use the website to pull up my pricing as well because they almost always either hang up or book out of embarrassment.

17.0,"You're so much more patient than I am.  After two times of her not answering back because she was on another phone, I would have said for the recording, ""Releasing call due to no customer response,"" terminated the call, and if possible, notated the hell out of her account for the next person to read.  I don't have time nor the patience to deal with that sort of bullshit.~~That's the kind of person that needs to be fired as a client. If the actual client asks tell them their assistant needs to learn how to treat people. I'd have fired her and her boss as clients within a few minutes. You don't want to let me do my job and feel you can dictate what's going to happen? No, get fucked.~~I had something similar happen yesterday, but it was at the end of the call. Helped this guy changed his password and log into the app I work for. Had an upbeat and friendly voice (my current service voice is super sweet). At the end he was thankful as I was hanging up his wife said she should apologize to you for her attitude. Like the fuck? I was beyond patient and kind. Some people just like to complain~~Flight attendant: I'm sorry sir, but in your child's best interest, I'm having him sit with someone who will teach him some manners and help him learn that you can't go through life bullying people until you get your way.

(We can dream) But seriously, does the father not realize he and the mother have perfectly available laps for the baby, and in the offchance that the child is old enough to be required to be in his/her own seat, nobody is going to make a child that young sit alone because no stranger on the plane wants to be responsible for someone else's child for the entire flight.~~I know how the aftermath of those calls go.  Unexpected assaults can be pretty threatening, even for the experts like you.  Im sorry that happened to you and that you had to collect yourself for a moment after that call.  What pisses me off about these kinds of interactions is that the purpose of the call was to book an excursion.   Its not like you were telling him hes going to do life in prison.  What an asshole.  I feel your pain.  ~~Doesn't that interaction just make the day go by so much better?! I'm limited to five minutes per phone call or I get penalized, but sometimes I have a good 20+ minute phone call that's just so pleasant i don't even care because about 75% of my calls are sterile at best intro, what's the problem, fix, disconnect.~~Thats amazing, i get in situations like this pretty often, even hear when customers call again with another phone number in case i don't tell them what they want to hear. In my work they don't let us talk with customers about what we hear, we can only talk about things they are saying directly to us, it sucks~~I got this more often than I ever would have imagined working in a call center for Amazon. One guy in particular was flagged because he would call in and ask the female reps to describe sex toys to him that he found on the website. It was really gross.~~Argh this is so frustrating. I've flown with my ESA before (it was our only option, even though I knew he wouldn't like it much) and I of course had documentation from my psychiatrist about him being necessary for my well being, PTSD and anxiety, etc. The folks at the gate, of course waaaaay after I had made it through security, checked in, and was ready to fly, gave me SUCH a hard time. They basically demanded that I explain every detail of my mental illness otherwise they wouldn't let me on with my ESA. it was extremely frustrating but given stories like OPs, I can kind of understand. 

TLDR: asses like this lady make life difficult for those of us who legitimately need support animals ~~I work for a major telco; TV, phone, internet, cellular. I just retired from the cellular side. But before going to the dark side or cellular I was in a somewhat obscure department of land line. 

Shortly before I left I got this call, the customer needed help getting a phone and discounts for her elderly, hard of hearing, legal blind mom. I must have said something like ""You've reached the wrong number but the right person!"" because that was the department I used to work in. 

So I was able to give her the quick tour of who to call and what to ask for. Even got her through just to make sure the numbers had not been changed since I was there. 

I'm sure you made Ted's day too because sometimes it's not just the people you help but the ones where you can go that extra mile. ~~Yup, this is all too common. I work at an airport and oh boy do travelers get rowdy over the smallest of things. It's understandable though due to the stress of it all. I do work a little on the customer service side of things and just some of the small stuff that comes through me is great but I always chalk it up to travel stress. =^)~~
&gt;* So generally the best advice is to book a ticket using the name as it appears on your travel documents.
&gt;


Can you tell this to a colleague of mine? She insists on only putting first and last names on tickets and then the middle name in the sfpd field. It drives me insane. Just put the middle name on the ticket. If it's on the documents, put it on the ticket, plain and simple. ~~Sigh. This just made me miss my days working on the ramp. Sure, the pay was nowhere near what I'm making now, but at that time in my life it was sufficient. I got to move around a lot which made the day fly by (see what I did there?), had flight benefits and most of all, basically 0 passenger/customer interaction. Just me, my crew, the plane, their cargo and a lot of shit-talking about ATC.

Good times, man. Good times.~~I think one of my favorites was ""I'll have your job!!!"" to which I replied at the end of a long and demanding night ""You want my job?  You can have it.  I work long hours, get slave wages, and have to listen to rude people all day.""  

Thank God that was not a call that got monitored.  ~~My battle buddy's mom in Basic was a stewardess for United and reguarly flew that route but took a few days off to see him off.  We were supposed to report on 9/11. I actually saved the paper that shows that's the day we were supposed to leave. We ended up leaving a few days late.  I haven't talked to him since then but she hadn't gone back to work in the 10ish weeks we were in in processing and training. ~~I have had people give me their credit card numbers without any hesitation, but as soon as you ask for a phone number they freak out. 

*Yes, I am making barely above minimum wage to take your phone number for my own nefarious purposes. I just want to be able to call you if the hotel is overbooked, but whatever, good luck finding another hotel when you find out the hard way at 3am.*~~I really feel for those who had to deal with this woman.  After 17 years of working in a call centre. I got down apologising to a fine art.  I even asked one repeat caller who had a small issue what he needed for him to stop ringing. It was $25.00 and a written apology.  I wrote the best BS non-apology in history which included that this was a final settlement on this issue and credited $25.00 to his account. Never called again.  Saved the company and other reps months of harassment.~~Seems like some people just develop a hatred for customers and have zero empathy left for another persons situation.   As I  work for a bank I deal with these scenarios numerous times a week.  

 I can not see in this day and age that a reservation can not be just removed if a ticket had not already been printed.  

Imagine if all your income was tied up in a failed website transaction and for some jobsworth customer service advisor tells you ""computer says no, hard luck mate"".  I bet you would rant and swear as well.   

Terrible situation to be in thanks to a cock up by the company.  ~~There was a girl I dated once or twice. Didn't work out, but she was elated that I was the first person who didn't need it explained that her Cross of St. Peter (inverted cross) tattoo wasn't a satanic symbol. (She was an atheist, so not sure why she had it, but, eh.)~~I had that once

&gt;you're obligated by law to give me your agent id

&gt;no sir no such law exists

&gt;I'm going to report you! You are obligated by law to give me your agent ID...

&gt;can I ask which law?

&gt;by law you have to give my your agent id

*click*~~I worked for a hotel call center then as well, although not yours (we didn't have points). I was surprised at the lack of flight crew calls that day. 90% of the calls I took that week were cancellations and changes. I consider myself lucky that I was laid off from my part-time airline job a month before it happened.~~Mailing invitations once, I asked friends for their address and they freaked out.  They wouldnt give it to me, and told me to send them the evite (which I wasnt sending out, Im old fashioned.). I had been to their home, I had their phone numbers, we saw each other a few times a month... it just seemed such an odd boundary for information.  Hey you can know how to get to my house, but how dare you ask me the actual address!~~I hate the basic economy ticket so much. At least with the LCCs and ULCCs, most people know what they are purchasing. With the mainlines, since the rules are different for all, people dont understand why others dont have the same rules. Their comeback is why didnt you tell me. Well, they do but most people dont read. At the end of the day people are pissed for no other reason than lack of effort on their end but its always taken out on the airline and their reps.~~My thought process while reading your story:

*She's going to ask for a supervisor, she's going to ask for a supervisor, she's going to ask for a... ah, there we go.*

Can't they comprehend that there are delays due to the Covid-19 outbreak? Everyone's cancelling their vacations, of course stuff like this is going to happen.~~I used to work for an answering service. I had to call a tech for a company to pass on a message about a job. As I was ending the call I overheard him say something derogatory which seemed to be aimed at me. I complained how unprofessional he was to my team leader and was told I was 'overreacting'. They never even followed it up.~~","The commenter expresses frustration with a customer's behavior and suggests that the person should be fired as a client. They also mention a similar experience where they helped a customer change his password and log into an app, but the customer's behavior made it difficult for them to communicate effectively. The commenter"
17.0,"Hahaha that's amazing. It's funny how even though I haven't worked in that industry, people always try to play the ""loyal customer"", and ""i'm gonna sue you"" cards. 

I used to work escalations for a cellphone provider. I decided to read the terms and conditions from start to finish and actually understand them. Then when people said they were gonna sue I would politely say go ahead, this will get thrown out because it's in the customer agreement ;)~~We would have people demand that we turn their services back on even though they hadn't paid their bill. Had one person threaten to call the state police and send them to our call center to force us to turn on the service.

Another guy told us that we were stealing from him because we wouldn't turn on his services (that he hadn't paid for in 3 months) and that he was going to call Interpol on us...

~~Was cx in the US?  I find that my fellow Americans can act like the most helpless, useless, laziest people on the planet. The older generation is the worst. Yet they yell about how lazy and delicate the younger generations are. Hey gramps, you dont want to hit a few buttons on your tv remote, but we are lazy?~~I'm having a low tolerance for this today.  

I told one lady today:  
""Ma'am we are prioritizing our customers right now that may be affected by the largest hurricane in history. If you are unable to print your boarding pass from home you will check in at the airport. Is there anything else I can assist with other than checking in?""

~~This.  Be nice, treat them like humans, explain what you are trying to accomplish, thank them for all they have done for you.   It gets you further than yelling and screaming.  Also, it gets noted in your file how you treat them. Many a time the ones who complain the most get the least positive outcomes.   There is so much that being nice gets you verses being a asshole.~~Theres no pleasing the average user/customer.

&gt;how do you know my name?!

I mostly got ""can you see whats on my screen"" when people were having tv issues, or computer issues but never told me any information on where they even were, and ""dont you have all my information on your screen there?"". 

Like no we don't, why the hell would we? This is it support and you called in randomly, the phone never asked you for any identifying information so *why* would I have anything on you???~~This so much, why do some customers pull this shit where rather than just letting you help them they yell and scream and hold their breath over a basic issue and escalate and make you transfer them to a supervisor rather than just letting you do your job and fix the problem. ""WHY WON'T YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB, YOU'RE PAYED TO DO THIS AREN'T YOU?"" well if you would shut the fuck up and actually listen to me we could have had you done and sorted by now.~~The best part is you know damn well this guy is going to say ""dammit! These airline people are giving me the runaround!"" since it obviously wasn't his stupid ass's fault.

I usually get pretty to the point with people like that. If you're too stupid to get it through your skull when I say ""Alright, now I'm afraid my department wouldn't be able to handle that, however the department that does handle it is open for about 10 more minutes. They're given access to certain tools and are able to view certain information and would be able to assist you better than I could at this point, can I go ahead and put you on a brief hold while I transfer you over there?"" and start yelling at me I *will* put you on a 2 minute hold till you calm your tits down.~~I had a customer who was pissed off because I couldn't give him a promotional discount that ended weeks before. To make it short, he escalated to my boss, but when I asked if I could put him on hold (as we are supposed to get permission) he started screaming ""NO DON'T YOU HANG UP ON ME"" over and over. I said I won't disconnect but I need to put you on hold. Finally I had to ignore him and put him on hold without permission. He still didn't get what he wanted. Asshat. ~~I work for a hotel company and we deal with this allll the time. The worst thing is that ""Emotional Support/Therapy"" dogs aren't  covered by the ADA for hotels, but people try and bring their dogs allllll the time and say they're emotional support animals. Usually ladies with their pocket pets. ~~There was no one in a supervisor position the call could be transferred to? Not even a voicemail for the one out? Unless this is a crazy tiny airline I would imagine there is more than one manager / supervisor that works there.

And what is the justification for hanging up? Theres either a lot missing or the friend should not have hung up, there was no justification for that. If this is all that happened and I were that guy I would be calling back and complaining about the worker.~~I had one once where a guy said he was in his lawyer's office and he was going to sue us over a $15 charge to his account. Apparently he actually was at his lawyer's office and the lawyer could be clearly heard yelling at the guy about what a terrible idea that was.~~I'm a bit sus. I highly doubt any CS position would allow your kind of conduct.

As vilifying as it is, I can't imagine ANY company being okay with it. I would 1000000% love for this experience to be real, but there is NO WAY your employer let this happen. Unless you got incredibly lucky and the customer just happened to not escalate the issue.~~In our call center, we have a rule about swearing - or anything offensive - that we are almost NEVER allowed to release a call, but if they get too personal with the swearing, we can tell them it is offensive and that we reserve the right. For my call center, the ability to hang up is almost as sweet as nectar from the gods.  ~~Curiosity wise I would like to know how nice the higher end customers are on average. Are they rude and entitled like everyone that I get here in a call center for banks all over america for online banking/bill paying, or are they usually at least half decent and just want to get their issue resolved like most people?

From my perspective with all class types it seems the poor whine a lot and call the wrong places out of apathy and uncaring, the middle class can range anywhere from the same to slightly entitled but usually have the best callers, and the rich seem to always make a fuss about a penny lost any and every time it happens then demand overcompensation as if it really matters/is worth the time anyway.~~I've spent many hours in ATL on various layovers, including a 12 hour layover on military travel. There's a ton of cool stuff and art exhibits all the way down the main spine, and the concourses branch off from that. If you're ever there, make sure to head all the way down to the end to concourse E, it's the international concourse so they have the better restaurants, and a Caribou Coffee. ~~I used to sell small appliances. I shit you not I had people say things like ""it said one yesterday. It should have saved it for me"" and ""it showed me what was available for me not for others.""

People actually seemed to believe that. For no particular reason I could figure out.~~The weird x thousand miles system always confused me with airlines. The circumference of earth is only a little over 24 thousand miles. It seems like it would make more sense to call them points, or like, funbucks. Miles just makes customers confused when they can't go on a 1000 mile flight using 20,000 miles. ~~Worked for a company who's packages shipped from Boston. Couple years ago the week before Christmas Boston got 3 feet of snow. Obviously packages are delayed. People who called from the west coast could not wrap their head around this. One guy even said his sister was in NY and they had a foot. She was able to get out just fine. Yes sir, 3 feet and a foot are exactly the same...  Spent 45 minutes on the phone past the time I was supposed to be off. ~~So...as I understand it, emotional support animals aside, SERVICE animals don't usually have physical documentation isn't that correct? Which is why it is unreasonable to request ""ID cards"" for a service animal and in compliance with the ADA if a person says ""hey this is a service animal"" it is against the law to request such identification. A SUPPORT animal is a whole different thing and you are required to have a ""note from your psychiatrist or physician."" So in reference to some of the comments here saying that an airline (since they have separate jurisdiction) can request physical documentation for a SERVICE animal, how is that possible if no such ID system exists?~~I collected car payments &amp; worked in a call center for a few years (dark, emotionally damaging years). Oh, transmission issue? Im not the company that built it, Im with the company that lent you the money to buy it. Not my fault that you chose this car/truck/van.

Nobody understood that there can be completely different divisions with the same name. Dealership wont fix a dent for free? Dont care  Do you stop paying the mortgage if the roof leaks?

Trick I used with screamers? Complete silence until they calmed down. Then Id start telling them something while toggling the mute button. If they calmed down &amp; actually paid attention, Id do what I could to help. If not .... 
~~Sounds like a guy who used to call the CS number for a client I took calls for. He'd hang up if a male answered, but sit there and waste time (and presumably jerk off) if a woman answered. Couldn't block him though because every time he'd just keep pressing zero in the IVR so a number didn't come up~~Back at that time, I was working in a fast food, as one of the assistant managers.  The store manager was on vacation for 2 weeks over that time period, which made things hectic for us.  However, he didn't tell us where he was going on vacation, so we didn't have any idea.  Turns out he was vacationing in the area.  He told us about it when he got back from vacation.  Ended up on the local news, too.

His tour group was supposed to be visiting the towers on 9/11, but their tour guide came down with a stomach bug on 9/10 and called in sick.  They couldn't find a replacement, so they rescheduled that part of the tour for 9/12.  Imagine the thoughts running through his head that fateful morning...~~well i dont think its the fault of the exploiting customers, that there is an exploit because it was designed to make more money of passengers not knowing about this ""trick"". to me it isnt a trick by the customers but rather by the airlines to fuck regular customers more than needed.~~","The commenter, who used to work in escalations for a cellphone provider, shares their experience of dealing with angry customers who threatened to sue them for not turning on their services. They also express frustration with the older generation's tendency to act like ""lazy, useless, laziest people on"
17.0,"It took me forever to figure out that those abbreviations I've always used for Charlotte and Atlanta were the airport codes. I live almost equidistant from the two, so short day jaunts to one or the other are common, as is flying in/out from them rather than the local airport.~~Woe betide the incautious traveller dealing with Bangkok who doesn't check what airport his flight's leaving from.

There's more than a few people used to flying one airline who then book with another and don't check too closely, and end up going to Don Mueang (DMK) when the carrier they booked with flies out of Suvarnabhumi (BKK) instead.~~This is when lawyers get involved. Customers sue for stuff like this. Then, in court lawyers find every reason to put the airline company at fault.

A good lawyer can win the case and that guest can get a refund. In some cases, airlines will settle before it gets this far.

As a customer, you must learn how to game the system. When lawyers get into the fight, airline companies tend to reevaluate their stance with customers. There are airlines who fight back. But when it goes to court, lawyers fights gets stronger and airline companies usually stand down at some point.

So how do I know this?
My family member is a lawyer in NYC and shes had tons of cases like this.~~This person might be from Africa.  When I was there, people transported damm near everything in or on the bus - chickens, goats, pigs, all sorts of furniture.  One of the few things that were not allowed were coffins.  I think it was because people were scared of bringing something symbolic of death (or a dead body) in the coffin, so folks would get freaked out.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago a folding coffin was developed in Nigeria that was made from tri-wall waxed cardboard.  Think a bankers file box - but a lot bigger.  These became super popular because they were cheap, came in a bag and were flat-pack so that it was obvious that there was no body and it wasn't obvious that there was a coffin, and could be strapped to the top of bus.

&amp;#x200B;

So I can certainly understand why a person might make kind of phone call to make sure cultural rules are respected.~~Why would any plane allow pets to be carried onboard with the other passengers? What if someone is allergic? What if the animal poops and it smells the entire plane up? What if the animal barks or meows LOUDLY during the whole flight? There are too many what ifs!

Discriminating against her cat because it is fat? Oh, my my! That lady has some imagination! ~~I cant say where I work, but I assure you one of the largest airlines in the world doesnt have a ""poorly constructed website""

She literally made the same reservation from scratch several times, and with a different airline. Why would the responsibility fall on the company to give her a refund for not only the accidental bookings but the initial booking?

Theres not wanting to help, and then theres getting yourself fired for breaking company policy. I would never ask company A for a refund after I made a purchase with company B on the strength on company B's policy. Thats absurd.~~Oh my gosh!! Lol I honestly can't believe the stupidity of some people! Wow, he really thought his insane idea would work? Lol, yes, sounds crazy but some Americans still don't know that Canada is a whole nother country. Source: I'm Canadian, live in Canada &amp; have heard alot of shit like that!~~I love when people threaten to dispute charges.  I had one lady call in to ask why we still had get money after she disputed with her credit card consent multiple times.  I had to explain that we get to respond to those disputes, and that her not reading the literally four sentences of terms and conditions before placing her order (and again on every one of hey invoices) didn't make the charges fraudulent.

That was my second most rewarding call.~~Guys, please remember the rules and the Reddit wide rules of not naming the company you work for.

That lady needs to get with reality.  You want to travel with your ESA?  You need a letter from medical personnel, OR a prescription from a doctor and a letter from a therapist.  All the rest of us have to do it, so she does, too.

I really don't understand people, thinking they can take advantage of something that was specifically done to make people like me more readily able to travel.~~{{{HEADDESK}}}

The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA. This definition does not affect or limit the broader definition of assistance animal under the Fair Housing Act or the broader definition of service animal under the Air Carrier Access Act.""~~I love this, mainly because I personally think Im way too weird and have too obscure interests to genuinely connect with the mostly older/professional people I speak to all day. 

Old ladies are nice but they sometimes tell jokes that are so mild mannered I dont even realize they are making a joke. Then I feel bad for giving my fake laugh which sounds even more fake because it was delayed.~~I honestly feel sorry for the airline workers.

Because I'm the IT support of airlines, I get lots of calls from passangers that should call the airlines, since  our number is supposed to be only for airline workers lol.

The passangers can be real assholes since they can always be from a different country, and it's inherent to deal with that.~~When I worked remote I would get long racist rants etc. Im based in America Im non white though
It was hilarious they assumed I was white because of my voice and my name. Im like even if I was white doesnt mean Id agree with you. But like you I tired to get them off the phone as quickly as possible~~I hate it when people do this. You know, if I ask for something from a person, company, whatever, and the answer is ""NO"", I may try to give a rebuttal or two. But it doesn't take 45 minutes of someone repeating the SAME THING over and over to get me to understand that the answer is ""NO"". Normal people think this way. ~~Love the why are there 6 transactions on my card, I only wanted one ticket chats.  They whine and complain and refuse to see that it's their impatience that got them into this mess, and that no they can't dispute, no it's not fraud and no I can't just take it off the account.  Call the merchant, and nicely ask if they can help. 

I wish I could just tell them to bring a friend on their trip at this point but they probably don't have any.~~No, people are allowed to be upset about losing their money. I also work at a call center so I know how people are. I would be pissed if I wasnt refunded everything. You expect people to not be upset when they arent getting a full refund? Get a new job man~~Pardon my criticism, I know it comes from left field, but I think youre on the wrong side.

Help the people not the capitalists. 

Long ago there was a credo that the customer is always right, and surely there are times where customers unfairly took advantage of that, but in recent years big business has fucked us all over. 

Case in point, you dont even transfer to a supervisor and your internal communications are such that youve teamed up against helping this dude out. 

That sucks. 

(...and here come all the down votes)

Power to the people!~~","The commenter explains that it's common for customers to book with multiple airlines and end up at Don Mueang (DMK) instead of the local airport.

18.0,"I'm pretty sure I know where you work and I'm pretty sure I worked there too and yeah not only is money more important, but they actively despise you. I would absolutely get out ASAP. As far as legal action, the guy who got his arm run over would have to press charges in order for anything like that to happen. It wouldn't be reported anywhere. Which he probably is, but there wouldn't be any way for you to know that.~~I've heard this from heating technicians. People call in to the gas company because their heat isn't working, they get told (like I was) that there are 150 people ahead of them for service and they'll be out in about 18 hours, so they figure they'll call in a gas leak and jump the queue. What happens, one guy shows up within the hour with a wrench and shuts the gas at the meter, says ""Now that it's safe, we'll be back in 18 hours to fix this...""~~The more I hear tales of customers abusing call centre staff, the more I despair at the state of humanity. Having worked in a call centre before, I'm always polite when I speak to the agent as I know a lot of stuff is out of their hands and they are not to blame. Sorry you had this guy complain about you, that's just unwarranted.~~Yeah. We get a lot of people that want their doctor to sign medical necessity forms so their electricity doesn't get shut off, when they have no reason for it medically (IE: meds that need refrigeration or CPAP to sleep, so on). You need a medical reason to NEED electricity, not just be disabled in some way. :P

They end up pissed, too. ~~I work in the energy industry in Australia and our prices change quite a bit (although not almost every day) and it always makes me laugh when someone gets a quote (which with our company is usually valid for at least 2 weeks) then calls back 2 or more months later to accept the quote and gets annoyed that the price has changed. I've stopped coddling them, nowadays I just ask ""was there any particular reason you didn't take up the offer then?""~~I was stopped at a traffic light across from a cemetery yesterday.  There was a lone cemetery worker cleaning things up.  He was throwing out dead flowers, emptying trashcans etc....   He was the only living person in the facility, and he was wearing a mask while he worked outside.

It made me wonder is some Karen hadn't called the cemetery office to complain that she saw one of their workers outside without a mask.   

Note- the mandate in our area is you only need a mask outside if you cannot stay 6 feet away from someone that is not a part of your household.  Even the residents of the cemetery were 6 feet under him and there was no other living soul around.  Who is making that guy wear a mask in the middle of nothing.~~My mother in law has dementia / alzheimers and she is in a ""memory care"" unit.  She called and said that she is being held for ransom and they are going to prostitute her if no one comes and gets her out.    She is 90 years old.   Never know what is going on sometimes in elderly minds.~~The obvious answer is: ""We're happy to come get - we will meet you at the ferry dock once you bring the car over the mainland, and pick it up from there"".

Of course, I know there's barely a chance in hell you'll be allowed to say anything so clearly logical...~~I work for a cable company and people say that all the time ""well my sister has your services and pays less than me"" cool I have no idea what service your sister has but your signed up for 4 services on the highest tier and have lots of movie rentals. It's pretty annoying~~Reminds me of the time I had an angry client on the line and at the end of the call he exclaimed ""Have a terrible day!"" To which I replied ""You as well!"" More out of habit than anything else. Of course the call was graded. I didn't receive a coaching but I did get a line item deduction. It was totally worth it. No regret!~~I work in a call center for auto/home ins. It amazes me the people who have poor payment history, and wonder why their premiums are so high or that the underwriter decides to non renew. Then when they want to reinstate act like we are robbing them when letting them know they have to pay the missed install amount and next install.  Like that amount doesnt just go away.~~Wow can't believe they waved it. Company's shouldn't give in to people like these. If they don't have potential to win the lawsuit tell them to fuck off. Then use all that money they are saving and throw the good guy a bone once in awhile when someone's nice to your reps and company and just in a bad situation. ~~Technically, you called her request sexist, not her specifically, and it was most definitely sexist. I can't believe your call center wants you to put up with that. My boss would never coddle a customer asking for a man halfway through a call just because he didn't want to speak to me (because of my gender).~~Back when I worked for a gas and electric company, I had a man call in a gas leak at his stove. I told him as per safety protocols to wait outside for our tech. He was like no need theres a window right by the stove. Ill just smoke a cigarette while watching for the tech. I had to explain to him why that wasnt a good idea. So many people dont understand how gas works!~~JFC what a pain in the ass customer. He obviously just didn't want to pay the cancel fee and 'no capital letters' was the best excuse he could come up with?? I can't believe the other supervisor gave him another $50. 

Why are some higher ups so hell bent on PAYING people to leave the company? They do this at my place too, waive HUNDREDS of dollars in cancel fees because the customer is unhappy and switching providers. It's not like *waiving* cancel fees is gonna get them to stay with us. What backwards logic. You break the contract, you pay. Welcome to the adult world. ~~I love it! People have such interesting ideas of how electricity works. 

My favourite from my own calls have been that ""kilowatt""  is a made up term that we as a provider use (came from an electrician) and the sweet lady that thought her bill was high because her neighbor used her wifi.~~I am retired from working at an energy utility. We had meter readers drive through the neighbourhood to electronically read the meters. So many crazy people calling thinking that we were reading the wrong meter and that they didn't want those signals floating through the air poisoning them! Then we would have to spend the next half an hour or more explaining how the system worked and that it was more convenient than physically reading the meter for all concerned.~~Ugh.  I feel your pain.  I work for an energy company here in the states.  I work third shift, so we only deal with emergencies.  Im sorry, but your bill is not an emergency at 3 am, especially since youve known about your turn off notice 10 days before, and call in at this hour to get an extension on the day its scheduled for disconnect.  I get sworn at a lot.  Sending long distance high fives to you.  I think youre the first energy representative that Ive seen on here besides me!~~It's all about what you're acclimated to. I'm from Oregon and like it cooler than anyone else in my family, but know a couple of guys from Alaska who wear tshirt and shorts long after I have to wear pants and a long sleeve shirt. Above 75F I hate the heat. I'd only visit Australia in the cooler months.

Edited for spelling.~~I dont know what town gas or bottle gas is but I'm guessing the heater she bought was a liquid propane heater and she needed a natural gas heater. If that was the case you can actually buy a converter that allows a propane heater to run on natural gas and a natural gas heater to run on propane.~~Medical necessity used to mean their power was restored first where I am.  It wasnt about a grace period for payment.  It has since been changed to area with biggest concentration of customers is restored first.  It does really suck because some of the old or disabled people and their families cant afford or physically manage generators and they have died as a result.  Someone likely told the caller outdated information or information based on a different power company.  But seriously think about it.  An extended power outage could mean certain death for someone  on a vent or needing oxygen at home.  Not everyone has the ability to load up all their medical equipment and haul it somewhere else while their power is out.  This is just another way that disabled people are at a huge disadvantage.~~Eurgh. I did my time in a british power company call centre too. you have my sympathies. Mine had the little fuzzy orbs as mascots. 

I did some time in the department that handled calls from people who got a payment reminder letter. We got a lot of people claiming that the bill must be wrong, and I have to say, as stressful as it must have been, the times when they were right were some of the most interesting calls. I was always happy when I got one of those as it was usually something that was fairly easily fixed once someone actually took a look at it. (Missed meter exchanges, wrong reading entered manually, missed tenancy change, wrong meter number on the account etc) Suddenly a huge bill came down to something much more reasonable and you felt like youd actually done some good for once.~~&gt;it's because you don't have tools or training for this.

Actually, that might be your escape route...

&gt;That code means a sensor in your unit is bad, but identifying the specific one will take someone physically checking them with specialized tools.  There's no way to identify it visually, or over the phone.~~I've done both B2B and internal support.

Got some guy fired for lying on the internal support job (he claimed he was a very high level manager, that the internal business org chart was wrong, and I ended up pushing an after hours call up the chain because no one was picking up their line, at midnight, to one step below VP level).

On the business support side, ended up getting a point-of-contact banned from calling us ever again, same account locked out of support because their end users would threaten legal action because they couldn't plug a phone line in and other such stupidity.

I've never had problems 'enforcing' stuff like this.  Bullies don't get free passes; I'm a much, much bigger asshole than they are.~~That was a shitty dick thing for her to do...I wonder how many times her mouth &amp; crap attitude has caused him to lose out during situations that might have helped him? 


When I get calls from people that are having a rough time, and they are honest about it and genuinely ask for my help--I will bend over backward to help them. But when a caller has a crappy, entitled attitude I won't help them even if it is within my authority to do so. ~~",The commenter believes that the person who got their arm run over in a call center would have to press charges in order for the incident to be reported.

This industry really needs to change and stop ass kissing customers like this. What should have happened after the 2nd documented time she called and abused an agent was refusal to deal with her via call - writing only from now on - all calls will result in the agents being allowed to immediately hang up.

In every single other setting a customer cussing someone out and acting like that would be removed from the premises, have police called and most likely be banned - why is it in the call centre world this is seen as normal and part of the job?

What should have then happened was after it was discovered to be her fault all this time, she should have been billed the cost of the 3 (?) engineer callouts.

~~Dom: Hi, Peter. What's happening? We need to talk about your TPS reports.

Peter: Yeah. The coversheet. I know, I know. Uh, Bill talked to me about it.

Dom: Yeah. Did you get that memo?

Peter: Yeah. I got the memo. And I understand the policy. And the problem is just that I forgot the one time. And I've already taken care of it so it's not even really a problem anymore.

Dom: Ah! Yeah. It's just we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS reports before they go out now. So if you could go ahead and try to remember to do that from now on, that'd be great. All right!~~Shes not wrong.  The system in place is designed to pressure buyers to buy at the price now, rather than take the time to figure out what they can afford and who would have the best price.  Its not your fault or the fault of your salesperson, but the truth is she IS being pressured to buy without thinking.

She still shouldnt be upset with you after you explain that its industry standard, though. It sucks that the system is set up that way but thats just how it is.~~i think what gets me is that not only did he decide you were going to give him a late payment but that he decided the amount for the payment  and it wasnt even that much - if youre gonna make ridiculous demands at least go all out on them~~You know what get's me, maybe you can answer, beginning of lockdown, we paid to have a smart meter installed, for the exact reason to avoid having someone come on. 4 months later, we still get a call from the gas guy, who says yeah, we get the readings from it, but we still have to check it. :facepalm~~I dealt with this on the regular with hotel rooms.  The price was based on availability, so as the hotel books up for those dates, the rate goes up, and while it can also go down if a lot of people cancel, that was pretty rare.  I'd seen the rate go up while I was on a single call, more than once.  But I still dealt with people on the regular who would accuse me of trying to rip them off when I'd recommend they hold the room to lock in the rate.  I'd also get accused of that when they'd call back in and the rate changed, just like they were told it would.  You can't win.~~I ran a b2b division for a PC e-tailer for a bit.  Every once in a while we'd get some 'middle manager' that thought he could abuse my agents.  Well we'd take the recordings of those calls and contact their managers, letting them know that we weren't there to be abused, and that cursing at somebody over the phone can result in their company being blacklisted.  

One time we got a contractor kicked off a GSA contract, and more than likely banned from the entire GSA system, because he told one of our reps that 'I work with the military, if you fuck this up I'll get a couple of my sniper buddies to come visit you.'  We did press charges as well as sending it to his local GSA admin.~~I worked for a water company and would get this all the time, there is an average amount of water a family of 4 could use but this can vary so much and a lot of our customers were on meters. They didn't seem to understand how it could be so different but some people shower twice a day and some other only twice a week and if there are kids in the house their water usage can be different based on their age, babies will oddly use more water than most pre-teens. But the customer will just think we are scamming them somehow.~~Back when I was a computer technician, I had an old cunt blame me for sending her to the hospital for heart problems and high blood pressure because I told her she needed to contact her email provider if she didn't want to pay me to. Never mind her house was full of fast food wrappers and she was upwards of 300lb on a 5'ish frame

""Well I show your bill last year same month was 310. The year before that is was 305 and the year before that is was 298. Looking at your hourly usage, I see a lot of gas being used overnight? Do you leave your heater on at night while you're asleep? Using your heater during the coldest time of day, it's going on all night long... ""~~Oh I love this sort of thing.

I have a friend who works for a broadband supplier who receives calls daily from ass hats demanding compensation for their broadband being down - said broadband is residential service only, not business and is generally known as being the cheapest in the uk, yet ass hats call and demand money for ""loss of earnings"" etc...

She takes great care to sound like she is ""making calculations"" - even putting them on hold - before returning to announce the ""good news"" that the manager has approved a ""generous"" refund.... Of 70 PENCE ( or similar low figure) to cover the cost of the day's outage ha!~~My father was scrapping an old oil tanker and decided to use a match to clean up the oil on the ground around it... Surprise! Just like in the movies the fire followed the oil back into the tanker that still had some oil in it and it blazed! They managed to put it out somehow but not before singing off everyone's eyebrows~~The address we have for you is not correct.  We need an updated address or account details to transfer the funds to.

Nobody read them, of course, at the time it was sell-sell-sell no matter what.~~\&gt; Occasionally we have areas that we schedule to be turned off due to regular maintenance

I think your company is doing it wrong. Electricity is important enough that there should be no planned outage beyond the second required to switch over to a backup circuit.

This is the case for all important infrastructure, like highways, water and electricity (with the exception of your apparently crappy company). Yes, maintenance has to be performed, but there are ways to do that witout cutting power for a longer period.~~Yup. Had a call a week or so ago where the lady I was helping started to say Im not racist, but and boy, if there is one phrase that will make me tense up faster than that one, I havent heard it yet. 

Oof. 

She went on to rant about BLM, why there isnt a white and/or straight pride month. I just went into what I call mhm mode, responding with mhm as I resolved her issue and then steered the call into wrap up. 

Some people man ~~while i dislike customers like that, i absolutely hate when managers do this.

we will constantly be told, this is ALL you can give them, blah blah blah.

you follow the rules and try to empathize best you can.  then they ask to be escalated, and BAM.  suddenly the customer thinks that YOU'RE the liar.  see?  i knew you could do more.  blah blah blah.  pisses me off.~~ *Me: So he said to replace it, and you had another company replace it  yes?*

*PM: I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MATTERS.*

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a better analogy for her.  Can I live at her property and pay another property owner the rent?  Why not!!??

*I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MATTERS.*~~I have a similar reaction any time I get a bill higher than usual...except instead of ringing customer support I check the last meter reading date and then go check the meter myself. Have caught out a water bill that way before when the claimed ""reading"" was higher than what my meter currently showed.~~I kind of understand the tech here - the ice maker makes ice - if it's not making ice, the problems would be the water line in, or the tray was cracked. The ice dispenser would be a different mechanism, and in the fridges I know, the dispenser also dispenses water so I would consider it a different mechanism from the maker. Same way the ice crusher and ice maker are not the same thing. In this case, the ice dispenser was broken.

Now whether or not this warrants a call to you is another story, but if something like the maker is covered under warranty but the dispenser is not, I could see why this might be a question from the tech. 

Edit: I don't know why I assumed this was a fridge. If it's a stand-alone ice maker, I think that's another story...~~","The commenter criticizes the behavior of a customer who repeatedly called and abused an agent, and suggests that the customer should have been banned from the call center for their behavior.

18.0,"I'm sorry you had to deal with the flailing, angry grasps at straws from someone at during worst part of their life.

I'd counsel you to see it as that, they've latched onto a negative interaction with you as part of the grieving process. We all see the worst of people in our 'profession' as I'll loosely call it, especially you in a complaints role.

I'm giving her the most charitable interpretation I can because the best thing a call centre agent can do for their own mental health is to try do the same, if you write off every customer as an inhuman monster it feeds into the negative thought spiral that call centre work can propagate.

 ~~I just left the AHS horror show trust me I wish I could have left earlier but it was for a paycheck. Even though it ate at me i needed to provide for my family.

And I know exactly what your talking about the difference was I wasnt allowed to tell the homeowners how much we were covering. Probably because it was so drastic we might cover 135 bucks but the homeowner has a 1500 dollar out of pocket.~~This reminds me of a case in my line of work. We do property inspections. We have one customer who lives in the US but the only way to access the sliver of American land they live on, is to drive from US through Canada, then back across the border to the US side. Well, no one has been able to cross international borders and they wont schedule a date to send their own photos to us. And believe me, we have tried everything. Didnt stop them complaining about it for months.~~This is why anything like that is accompanied by training, which is then signed by the employee that they understood the training.

This is to then be wheeled out when they fuck up by contradicting the training.

To which I reply ""is this your signature on the document saying 'if I move the printer without it being shutdown for 3 hours it will be permanently broken'?""~~&gt; A few minutes later my supervisor is telling me I can't call a sub sexist. whoops. I am supposed to tell her ""I am sorry you feel that way. You can call back until you are patched through to someone you feel comfortable speaking with.""

Im in the escalated / external complaints team and speaking to a customer over email who put the key in the meter without using up all the credit and wiped it even though the instructions sent with the key say thatll happen. asking us for the 80 shes lost, realised I wasnt going to give it to her, started saying she was going to call up and complain to a manager about me  I explained that Im in the senior complaints team and she wouldnt get higher than me~~I feel like ""doesn't use ink but wax. Yes, weird but true."" would have helped.

Then again, I am from a country that teaches people to gain knowledge and use that to think for themselves. 

Meaning we would also likely have moved it since we didn't have any reason to believe it couldn't be.~~Our stores are supposed to call into their own customer care support line and I hate when they can into general customer care, because honestly we can't help them. They have to call their own team and verify store number, dealer codes, token codes, rep IDs and a bunch of other things we don't have the system to verify. They get nasty when I say that. And the thing is if they cal back even their own team, it his my metrics for same callback in 48 hours. ~~Side note from an American: PAYG metering for electric/gas is fascinating! I had no idea such a thing existed. That said, my power company could easily do this considering how our meters work.

Also, this reminds me of a Dorothy Sayers novel set in London in the late 1920s. One character lives in a walk-up bedsitting flat. There's mention of penny coins needed for the shared bathroom geyser. It took me several years to figure out this was referring to coin-operated hot water.~~The discussions in the news about government caps haven't helped. I had to explain to my partner, who has a Masters, that the cap applies to average spending, not overall spending. It doesn't help that they won't cap by unit because standing charges are allowed to remain in existence. I also think the bill levelling doesn't help as it is not well explained to most people.~~Oh yes I work for a power company and we have that form as well.   I do feel bad for people who have medical issues that are without power because they need it to run their machines.   Though people confuse that form with power outages too.  

When people have power outages they seem to think that if they say they have a medical issue that we will just get theirs fixed first.  When in reality its like you say. We have to diagnose the problem and fix whatever the issue is before we can get the power back on.  We cant just push our magic button that customers think all call reps have to get their power on 
.   

If a tree fell on the power lines or damaged the transformer we cant still just get their issue fixed within a 3 minute phone call, sorry~~Technically it *is* a word and technically it's a synonym of ""despite."" It fits all the criteria of a word; it has a part of speech, a definition, and a first known use date of 1912 (according to Merriam-Webster).

[I did a write-up on this not too long ago]( after having the ""is it a word"" argument with a co-worker at my old job. ~~Back in 2012, I was at a company where now Better Matters.  It was during Superstorm Sandy, and graciously they killed over the phone surveys for about a 1-2 week period.
So this lady from Jersey calls in, you know pretty much the worst hit area, and she's bitching on and on about how her internet on her smartphone was non-existent.  I let her vent and calmly asked her if she had power at the time, and she sharply told me ""no, why should that matter!?!?"" 
And this is where real talk came in and I was telling her we were in one of the worst storms to hit and she's lucky her cell phone was even working for calling.  I'd like to think that she realized she was wrong because she muttered a few things under her breath and said good bye and hung up.~~I have had a couple. We're located near a university, so we tend to get some ""questionable"" calls during fraternity pledge season. The one I remember most was a guy telling me that he was a traveling circus performer and his pet snake had bit him in the nose and he wanted to know what he should do about that. All of this with a really fake Indian accent. Of course I just had to follow my script and tell him I can't provide medical advice, but he could go to the emergency room if he felt he needed urgent care. I was just rolling my eyes the whole time. 

And then there are those calls where the people are so dumb that you kind of hope it's just a prank and not a real person because it makes you worry about the condition of humanity! ~~That reminds me of when I was helping a delivery driver when he couldn't find someone to sign for an order at a high school. I called both phone numbers on the account, and two more that I scrounged from some recent account notes.

All of them were some variation of 'not interested' or 'I don't have time for this'. As they all indicated they did not want me to call them again, we had to cancel their order (complete with cancellation fee) because no one could be contacted to sign for it.~~&gt;C: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!! YOU ARE LYING!!! GET ME A MANAGER ON YOUR FLOOR RIGHT NOW AND DON'T YOU DARE EVEN *THINK* ABOUT PUTTING ME ON HOLD OR I WILL HAVE YOU FIRED!

I know they're not really thinking it through but how do they expect to get a manager without being placed on hold or at least stepping away from the phone? ~~Damn, lady. I understand being upset, thats shits a lot of money. But its not your companys fault lol if anything its HER fault for not following instructions..  have some humility, people. 

Thats where these crazy people fail most, you can be upset, you can have alllll your feelings and concerns but you cant just go off on some call center person because youre not getting your way... ~~Yeah I have had clients go from batshit insane to my BFF after getting permission to turn a ""no"" into a ""yes"". Most times, it is left in the hands of leadership and you're the messenger but somehow that translates into ""agent refuses to help"" . At the end of the day, I am paid to enforce the rules of the company and manage client expectations and not be a Yes man.~~You dont know what a thermistor is. You cant fix it. 

Honestly, nervous for when I start my call center because I have explained things like that before. You know what this thing is? Then no, you need to wait for customer service to help you.

""i don't know what's the exact  reason. Maybe they have different devices, are less home or different hobbies. We can help you with some advice to figure out our how to save energy.

When we banned someone we didn't just ban their account. We had our so that if you made a new account but used the same IP or computer as you did your banned account to play, that new account would get banned. Basically, we banned *you*. 

So he got banned, bought a new copy of the game, made a new account,started a new subscription, and played the game a bit. Logged off. Tried to log in later and couldn't. His reasoning for why he shouldn't be banned was because he did nothing wrong on that account.

Has she never heard a guy talk about his wife as his ""better half""?

We literally werent able to help at all purely because they dont own the property. I really dont miss those days so many entitled people who werent happy waiting just a few hours.~~This reminds me of people who demand a callback from the company's CEO.

I can't even name the company's CEO, let alone get them to call you back lmao.

Also customers can always refuse entry to the meter readers, right? We have analogue readers and we send the readings in to get our bills each month. Nobody comes out to check on them.~~1. You just gotta laugh at people like that. The fact they think anyone cares enough to micromanager their users to that level is a bit crazy. 

2. I've got your service and I gotta say, when the hurricane hit us I expected full in power outage for days. Didn't lose anything in my complex. You guys rock. ~~Completely irrelevant comment, but I just scored a $1800 dollar fridge/freezer for $100 from big box store.  It wouldn't fit into customers house without removing the doors, so the contract delivery person removed the doors, there were pesky wires so they just cut them, did not attempt to fix or report it, and installed the fridge and left, despite it not powering on at all.    ~~This happens a lot in the computer world too. I would get customers calling to tech support with an issue. I would run diagnostic and verify the fault. Bit the computer is out of warranty with our company.

Then they call back fuming because they hired an outside contractor who either overcharged them or messed up the computer even worse.~~You say trying to sell an expensive heater most people cant use.

Isnt a bottle gas heater the kind that *everyone* can use? Even if you have natural gas piped to your house you totally *can* put a propane tank in your heater. The other way around isnt going to happen.

Or is this a thing that is plumbed in to the house gas supply but the house gas supply comes from one of those big propane tanks out back that is refilled by a truck?~~Same industry, other side of the pond. My customers are all mad that we are NOT reading meters again. Maybe if you would wear a mask, Karen, your city might not be on shutdown again for the 20th time...

Gov_co owns the pipes, and distributes gas on those pipes, how does Alt_co distribute gas on those pipes?

I remember one instance we had these kids prank call like 9 times in 2 hours so my supervisor actually ended up calling the parents.

Occasionally we get a really rude store associate. We have an internal escalation tracker that is supposed to go straight to the store's DM. 

Sometimes when things are slow, I read the tracker entries because some are freaking hilarious. I began to notice a certain store &amp; manager being repeatedly reported. The manager was really being horribly rude to our agents. She was tech illiterate and constantly blamed it on us, raged at our agents, asked if we ""knew how to do our freaking jobs"" and demanded a supervisor (we do not connect the store associates with sups, they must wait for a call back).  Nothing was being done.

If my suspicions are correct, there's a good chance I've even talked to you if I'm dealing with one of my many pissants.

If that numb nuts customer called in using coverage that was associated with their auto insurance policy, their auto insurance carrier might actually be the ones actively investigating it. This is especially going to be the case if the insurance policy was active at the time. Even if it involves a roadside claim, because there's bodily injury, it can go against the auto insurance portion. Dude still has workers comp to go against, but they'll ultimately subrogate against the auto policy.~~As someone working for an electric company, I feel you. They always like to point out that it's us manipulating their bills when we have no control over their usage, the kind of appliances they're using, etc.

I got an email from the supplier before my current bill cycle in THIS lockdown) that the reader wouldn't be looking to enter the house,just to email them my reading..If billing and communications aren't paperless,aren't the companies sending out updates by post,or using social media to let people know what's happening? sounds like a bit more communication could have saved that complaint from happening..~~I'm surprised to hear that meter readers are still doing the rounds - I'm in the UK, moved to my new home 10 months ago (2 weeks before the 1st lockdown), &amp; have been working from home since April.  Never had a meter reader or even a missed call card since moving here.~~One of the managers at my last job would move equipment all the time even though it was against policy for her to do so. The only people who were supposed to move any equipment was the IT department. Well, not good enough for her, she had to have it moved NOW and she told me to do it and I said ""No ma'am, against policy,"" so she did it herself. She ended up knocking out internet across more than half of the office because she didn't put the cables back into the router correctly. Listening to the direct of IT ream her from the next room over was beautiful.~~I work for the after hours (Answering Service)  line for several power companies. We always get ""I'm on oxygen! I need my power back on or I'm doing to DIE! Do you want my death on your conscience? I want a call back NOW with an ETA!!!""

I always want to say, ""First of all, this is what backup tanks are FOR. If it's worse than that, call an ambulance. Second, it's been out 5 minutes. They don't even know WHY it's out yet. Third, they can't call you and the other 200 customers that want a call because THEY'RE TRYING TO FIX THE DAMN OUTAGE!!!""~~It may be a language issue.

You said immigrant, so if perhaps there is a family/business leader, who does not speak/understand English, but is making a complaint through someone who does, they may not be getting all the information.

And if the person who DOES speak English is poor at retaining info, communicating concepts or just plain poor at communicating, that leader is just going to be getting more and more frustrated as despite your explanations to the intermediary, the answers they are receiving from that intermediary are incomplete or wrong.

This is all pure speculation of course. And I don't know what your process has in place for resolving language issues or even finding out if there is such a situation underlying this person's complaints.~~You guys need to install meters that can be scanned from the roadway.  That's what they use where i live.  They never even enter the property to read our meters.  (Customers are not responsible for reading their own meters.  That sounds kinda wackadoo that they would.  How can you be sure they're reporting the numbers accurately?)~~While I agree she was a bad customer,   What you did was wrong.

You hung up on a customer, and falsified your notes to put blame on Her.

What you shouldve done, apart from not lying, was to either transfer the call to legal once she threatened to sue, or said something along the lines of now that you have threatened legal action I can not continue this call.   I am notating your account, and any further contact must be done via our legal department.~~
&gt;""and don't you dare use Covid as an excuse, it's been happening for a year now, you should have adapted"".

&gt;Like no. The Government changes the rules constantly and we have to comply with them otherwise we're breaking the law, and honies, you ain't worth that.

They're actually completely right. Your management has had almost a year to unfuck this shit and hire more people or otherwise reduce the workload and the waiting period. 

It's not your fault, it's not the customer's fault. It's the fault of whoever decided that a 2+ month queue isn't reason to get some more capacity. 

Yes, it sucks when things change in short notice, but that's not the root cause for the 80 day wait.~~I don't know if you noticed, but you switched from ""Miss"" to ""Ma'am"" and back again when you were letting her know that she wasn't going to get the answers she wanted.

As a woman who both works in a call center and calls others for assistance, I would have found that shift in language infuriating.

I don't know if the above is a true record of the events or if it was a subconscious change made during your storytelling, but it may be something to consider before attributing someone's reaction to just being an uptight feminist. If I were talked down to like that, I'd ask to speak to someone else, too.~~I see her point. It came off as sexist, like as a woman she was incapable or not allowed to make financial decisions. 

Btw, the 1st comment on here pointed out the ""feminazis"" and how they're ruining the world or whatever. I think that's the exact opposite of what you'd see if you had been in the right.~~","The commenter states that their local supplier is following Covid guidelines and that if they get a card through the door, they can email them their own reading within 24 hours and get an accurate bill.

19.0,"Buck up and tell them to get their shit together. You dont want this to end up reflecting badly on you. 

Either a meeting or an email if you cant get them together: Hello managers, I need to discuss some inconsistent direction Ive been given. Mary wants me to tell customers to Fuck Off, but Bob is telling me to Kiss Their Ass. Please discuss this matter and let me know the resolution going forward so that I can update my notes and work efficiently. 
Sincerely, Auntie~~I get a request for a CEO once a week. The customers think that the higher up the chain they go, that the more sympathetic they'll be to their grievance. In reality, it is usually the opposite that is true. People assume that if I tell them something that I don't want to hear, that I am making a personal decision, rather than simply enforcing a policy that has already existed.~~I love the customers who use the Attorney card. A few of them I've had advised they had retained an attorney for the matter. 

Once I explained I can no longer assist then and they need to have their attorney contact us directly, they immediately recanted their statement.

""Oh, well I do apologize but you did advise on a recorded line you have obtained legal representation and I have already notated and flagged your account. You will now need to obtain a lawyer or sign and have notorized a form indicating you do not have legal counsel""

Almost all of them hung up right then. Often trying another agent.

I wasn't kidding when I said I already notated the account..~~The only saving grace when I worked in a call center was that if anyone threatened to sic a lawyer on us or that they were going to sue, we were told to just read off a prepared statement that said they would need to have their lawyer contact our legal department and then wed disconnect the call. Dont answer any other questions, dont engage, just read the statement and hang up.~~""Don't threaten me with a good time.""

One of my favourite parts of working with Dell is that as soon as someone threatened to sue, you'd immediately have to stop helping them and could only provide the information of legal as all communication must now go through them. It's probably why I got the least amount of threats to sue there. I wonder if they still have that policy.~~I've had that demand while the CEO was standing at my desk.. She went to the TL's desk and took the call, 'What makes you think I can do anything different to the agent who answered your call?' 'No, I don't know who you are, and, frankly, I don't care.' 'If you had parked legally you wouldn't have been issued a fine.'  


I was working in fines enforcement/collection at the time, dude was parked illegally, thought he could use being a well known local icon to get out of it..~~I try my hardest to understand the accent because anyone who can handle technical difficulties in their second (or third) language must be pretty intelligent and I am probably the dumber of the two people on the call. Definitely not about to get all high and mighty just because someone speaks multiple languages but has an accent in one of them. ~~I've had so many calls like this. The misunderstanding how CS works is so funny though. People think there is a law that you have to give them an ID. Customers constantly bring up the recording thing but my company only will use it for quality anyway, never to prove a claim.~~I've noticed that there are two ways of asking for a supervisor right off the bat. The first 'Hello, could I have a supervisor please' is usually a customer having some issue they believe only a supervisor can fix, and are usually okay people. But the second 'SUPERVISOR NOW' are always douches and abusive. It's pretty telling how two people can want the same thing, but the way they say it is indicative of how the call will go. But sadly the people who need to realize this are never going to.....~~Wow sorry you went through that. I definitely understand your situation. I came to reddit because I just got off a call with a guy who said he would put a gun to his head and I tried to calm him down but he said, ""Read about me in the obituaries"" and hung up. I come to reddit to and this is the first post I see in this subreddit. I have had calls like this before, but this one got to me. My job is so depressing because its about unemployment and since there are millions of people signing up and verifying their identity from all over the country the processes are slower and its taking a long time for people to get their money and I just can't anymore. I am almost at the quitting point, but I don't want to be on UI either. Its just so frustrating.~~I worked for an airline that had a great policy.  Once the customer mentioned an attorney, suing us or anything about legal proceedings, we were to give them the phone number for the legal dept and advise them that we were not able to speak with them any longer *DUE TO LEGAL ISSUES*. Sometimes we noted their record so the next few agents would also not speak with them!!~~""You are nothing and should learn your place in life."" 

Why is it that the nastiest customers feel the need to establish a bullshit 'pecking order' to make themselves feel superior? Had this happen yesterday at one of the stores I work at. Nasty old hag told me ""You work here. *Remember that.*"" 

Yeah, I do work here, and I'm a hell of a lot more pleasant than you are. I'm doing honest work and that's nothing to be ashamed about. I'm sorry you feel the need to ""put me in my place"" to make yourself feel better. 

And you, OP, are a better person than me. I would have hung up after being called the n word. Good on you for remaining professional. ~~Lackluster so far. She spoke to a supervisor, supervisor advised her to go to the airport. She insisted that something be done over the phone, supervisor filled out a lost and found form for her as a good will gesture but she still has to take her broken crap back to the airport.

I'm betting my left nut she gets a ""sorry bout that"" and a 25 dollar airport voucher.


~~What a dumbass.  Does she think she's the only one affected by the pandemic? Does she think it's business as usual for call centers with COVID-19 cases in some countries till on the rise?

By the way, since you work at home can't you tell her that?  Also working at home, and I'm free to say that to a customer if asked.~~In my experience these people have no interest in actually being helped. They just want everyone to be just as miserable as they are themselves. I'm so sorry you had to experience this person. But on the upside I can assure they really are the minority compared to most callers~~My call centre is dragging their heels on getting a process for this and it is so infuriating. We deal with people in genuine crisis and shitheads trying it on. 

Personally I do ask customers if they want to end the call so they can get emergency treatment, but or the idea of a behavioural health line.~~I had a friend who used to put customers on mute and mock them out loud.  One day the mute button didn't work. Apparently the simpsons quote ""money can be exchanged for goods and services"" convinced the customer to shut up and pay his bill.  I still can't believe he didn't get qualitied on that call and fired.~~Depending on how they got their job, some of them were promoted only because they have stayed there for a longer period (like more than a year) and got promoted over their ability and skill level. They are defensive and afraid that someone will notice they have no idea what they are doing and get demoted or fired.~~I told a customer once that I was fairly certain that she was correct about something, but since the situation was important, I can double check.

She said ""I don't NEED someone to DOUBLE CHECK. I NEED someone to KNOW! Is there someone there that KNOWS! A supervisor maybe?!""

I said ""well then you can call back and get someone else!"" 

She was speechless and I told her thanks for calling and hung up. Bitch. 

It would have taken two minutes to ask an underwriter real quick. She was just double checking on something an agent told her. ~~This would totally be r/thathappened material in any sub but this one. 

Which actually makes me laugh, because yes.. people *are* that shitty. And to talk to you in that way and then to suggest she is somehow better than you because she has two ""special"" letters in front of her name is such hypocrisy. I'm trying to figure out if this was an MD or not.

These kind of calls, at least for me, get me angry as shit in the moment.. but the next day they're hilarious. ~~I didnt get the call but someone else posted in our groupchat the customer just said he was going to kill himself what do I do? I advised to speak to a TL and if she was really concerned we could probably call the nonemergency line in his city and ask for a wellness check. A manager ended up calling him back and apparently the guy told him that he had meant to kill himself last year but hadnt gotten around to it.~~In the military, when you were given opposing orders by people of the same rank in your chain of command, you were instructed to inform the second person giving you the orders that they contradicted the first person.

You then followed the second order and then informed the first person.

Document everything!  And be prepared to go to their boss.~~Had a lady ask my bosses name and i gave her the first name and confirmed with my boss no last name allowed (pretty standard) and when she asked for the last name she used a shitload of profanity. 

Since I already warned her twice to stop i got to hang up on her and i bet she thought i was trying to avoid getting in trouble. Most satisfying hang up to date ~~I have dealt with this so many times.  Sometimes they won't take it if it's nothing that can be resolved and the customer just wants to complain about a process.  Multiple times, they have just waited and the person dropped off.  
Also, a customer was screaming at me not letting me say anything repeatedly and he demanded a supervisor.  Supervisor would NOT take it, I told her I wanted to hang up (grounds for firing).  She said she was trying to ""push me"".  I do NOT need anyone to push me.  I push myself every day just to show up.  ~~I once had a caller who insisted he *is* a lawyer. I told him if he really is a lawyer, he should know that what he asked me to do isn't legally in my power. 

He basically asked me to overthrow Covid-restrictions mandated by the government because he was mad his girlfriend had to pay money for a PCR-test in Spain.~~","The commenter advises against telling customers to ""Fuck Off"" or ""Kiss Their Ass"" as it could lead to negative consequences.

I calmly said ""Yes, I understand entirely. I know exactly how it feels to have somebody cut you off over and over again for no reason.""

She wasn't very smart, so she assumed I was being genuinely empathetic and this de-escalated the entire call.~~The closest I've ever come to anything like this is when I've been repeatedly cut off by the customer. I just go completely radio silent and let them rant. Then they realize I haven't responded to me and pull the ""are you even listening to me?"" Thing and I just calmly explain that I was waiting for them to be ready to listen to what I have to say instead of cutting me off. It usually tends to work. ~~I worked at apple for 20 years. You would be surprised the number of callers that just demanded to be transferred to Steve Jobs or Tim Cook, thinking that would get them whatever they wanted. Fortunately I was pretty high up the escalation chain and could just say no, they were stuck with me so we better get started talking about their issue.~~""I have eight different bosses right now. Eight, Bob. So that means that when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled; that, and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired.~~This made me smile, because yes, I've had a few of those calls. Matter of fact, I had one a couple of weeks ago.  She said, I need to speak to (insert CEO's name).    It still leaves me a little flabbergasted when it happens and makes me silently laugh.   Our suggested response is to take ownership of the call and assist, but if they keep insisting, we can say, I'm sorry I don't have any information other than what is on our website. 

Oh and I've had a few calls, where they immediately request a SUP and refuse to tell me anything.  I can usually eventually get something, but I've had a couple in which I couldn't and yes, the SUP did not like it. (They forget what it's like on our end).~~What kind of company is this?

""Mr. Customer, I'm still waiting on my supervisor, but I have to tell you, I do this all day, everyday, and I can definitely fix this now if you don't want to wait any longer, sound good?"" 

*customer agrees, fix issue* 

""Thank you for giving me the chance to help you. Did you still want my supervisor?""

*or customer declines your help and still wants a supervisor immediately*

Hang tight while I see if I can speed up that supervisor, ok?""~~I once had a caller asking repeatedly for a supervisor for over 20 minutes. They refused to even give their name or account number, and our policy was that we needed the account information ready for our escalations team to look over before being transferred. I even put them on hold to confirm with escalations and they refused to take the call unless I got their account details. It was a constant back and forth of ""I WANT TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR NOW"" and ""I sincerely apologize, but I cannot assist you or get you over to a supervisor unless you provide me some information related to your account"" until they cursed at me for a minute straight and hung up in frustration.~~A couple weeks ago, lady calls in irate and screaming that our IVR called her to remind her that her blood pressure medication was ready to refill. She said never to call her again, I offered to turn off the phone calls, she says no, kept asking why we called, I kept telling her and offering to turn off the calls, she kept saying no and then says: I need to speak with the CEO. The CEO doesnt even know I exist, btw.

I just said: Im gonna get you a supervisor instead and hit the hold button before she could respond. She disconnected immediately, but the escalation agent laughed her ass off when I told her that she requested the CEO for that reason.~~C: ""I want to speak to a manager""  
Me: ""I am a manager""

C: calls again: Hello, I want to speak to a manager! The last person lied and said he was a manager!

I kept explaining that I was looking at her bill and the numbers added up for me. She told me, in all seriousness, that that was because I was ""part of the system."" I had enough at that point and I asked her if she had the pencil and paper she used to add up her bill and she had them right in front of her. I then said ""I suggest you throw them away and use a calculation because adding on paper doesn't seem to work out for you."" She stopped arguing. I don't know if she called back, but I didn't get in trouble for the call.~~I had a lead who sat across the aisle from me, you know, like 8 feet away. If I was on a call too long and needing help, she would ignore my actual requests and yell out loud so everyone could hear her ""PREVENTFALLS, YOU'VE BEEN ON THAT CALL FOR 8 MINUTES!"" I'd continue to struggle through the call and get no assistance and then she'd go ""12 MINUTES!"" She hated me for some reason and the entire 6-8 months I managed to stay at that job she'd just talk about me instead of helping me when I needed it.~~I am amazed you didn't hang up on her after she started swearing. I would've warned her not to swear at me and if she persisted, I would've hung up on her.

Obviously, emotions can run high for people on occasion and I don't care if someone is swearing about the *company* or the *service* but if they start swearing at *me*, I am done caring about their problem. You don't get to treat another person like garbage, especially one who is trying to help you.~~As someone who was born in England now lives and works in a call center in the US.

 I get this from time to time.  I've had one person escalate to a supervisor and demand to speak to someone who speaks ""English english"". Recently I had someone when told I could not provide the call centers zipcode (supposedly security reasons) ask me to how many digits a zipcode consists of as proof I was in America, funily they did not like my brief lecture on the zip and zip+4 formats and hung up.

User: Can I speak to a supervisor?    
Me: No, my supervisor doesn't take phone calls.    
User: What do you mean no?    
Me: If you wish to escalate the matter you can speak with me or your manager. Those are your choices.    
User disconnects call.~~Yeah I'm not going to listen to someone calling me incompetent period. If it's one or two off hand comments, I usually let it go. But at that point, you had completed the purpose of the call and they specifically wanted to go out of their way to insult you. 

I had some guy screaming at me, cussing.. throwing what I can only describe as an adult tantrum. At first I was understanding because he wasn't speaking *at* me, he was just frustrated and in a bind. Once he started making it personal I asked him if he was done and I could speak, or if I was going to have to disconnect due to his language. 

He hung up so that made it easy ~~This kind of thing I never understood working in call centers. You get in trouble for transferring to the supervisor no matter how well you tried to descalate the situation. 90% of the time the supervisor would have me position a 24 hour call back, which I'm sure never happened. Which passes callers off further and the cycle continues~~i would have said ""oh you have our handbook? perfect. so that means you can turn to fake page x fake paragraph x and see where it says * insert what you explaining to them * "" when i did CS work i would call their bluff all the fucking time. never got in trouble for it because i have a knack for twisting stupid customers words on them~~My last call of the day today was someone calling in to complain that after threatening to cancel, the previous advisor had said that they could if they wished to and offered to transfer through to cancellations. The customer was horrified that we didn't break our backs trying to keep their custom. ~~My dad is a doctor. I clerked in his office for a while.

His issue was 100 percent within his control as he refused to agree to the online banking agreement. Like your statement that agreement was beyond my reps control. He wasn't happy with my options either which were simple he either agrees to it or not, if not we are more than happy to assist via the Ivr, phone or in a branch but he would not have online banking unless he reviewed and agreed to the agreement. 

Your feelings about the bank having a 58 page document I can somewhat agree with but will not change the fact that it will be required for the service.~~Supervisor here: I just love it when someone wants to escalate a mean call to me. I'll take 'em anytime of day. Because I know what I am doing, and how I can help them. It's almost a 50/50 tossup whether they'll suddenly become rational because they're talking to a supervisor, or whether they'll lose their shit even more. 

Even if they're rude and horrible to me, I don't mind. My agents knowing that I have their back is more important to me than some asshole's little problem.~~Our process is the similar to yours, except we have to have our security department contact the police rather than doing so ourselves.

One of my co-workers was threatened with someone tracking her down.

Well, if we didn't want to issue him a policy before....~~Yeah, got put on a performance thing with one of my managers. Never had another one before or since, and all the extra ""support"" I was supposed to get while on it? Never saw a lick of it.

I may have a customer service type roll in respects I can't tell them to F off or anything, but I am not customer service.  I can not just give the agent/client what ever they want.  Legally my hands are tied because legally we have to follow the laws of insurance in each state.  These agents forget this so often.  I can't tell you lately how many times they have said this customer service sucks.  One day I may slip and say, mr/miss agent, I am not customer service, I am underwriting.

Depending on how far they've fallen in the Net Promoter Score/The Customer Must Be Placated Or Else school, you might get written up for leaving the customer unsatisfied.~~Urgh, fuck customers like this. I had one who had me search for her online order - she had no order number. Took her details (name, address, e-mail address, contact number, date of order, items ordered...), nothing found. I asked her if she could provide me with the card number she paid for the order with, but nope I'm just too incompetent for her, and I should be able to find her order if I weren't so stupid. Fine, call escalated. It was the end of my shift so I listened in. First thing the supervisor does? Takes card details. 'well, if that incompetent fool I spoke to earlier just did that, we'd not have spent 20 minutes going round in circles!!' No, I DID offer to try it, but you decided to be a bitch about it.~~God I love when customers are put in their place for their own screwups. 

Moving up to T2 and being given permission to shut down a customer making unrealistic requests was a game-changer for me. I can tell people (respectfully) that they're living in fantasy and that I'm not doing shit for them because the issue was their own fault or not covered in warranty. 

EDIT: and also ""I am the highest you're going to get on a phone. While I have a boss, my company has empowered me to make a final call. Get fucked."" Not in those words, but I have had to drop the hammer a few times. Yes, there is nobody above me that you're going to talk to.~~I've only had this once for a situation that kinda made sense, but sucked for me because I had to deal with it.

How it worked was that this person was automatically renewed for like 5 years straight and he never noticed it. He demanded all 5 years refunded, stated no and I'll give him the last year. He demanded a supervisor. Normally my sup takes calls, but this must've been an off day because he said ""I'll wait for him to calm down and call him back"".

k

Went back on the phone with the guy and according to QA ""Had a 9 minute session of repeating the same information in different variations regarding the supervisor and not being refunded 4 of the 5 years.""

96/100 on that call. He didn't get that refund either.~~I had a major screamer once. It was a man calling from a shop, the sales assistant would apologise and then have phone grabbed from him, and this guy would just *scream*. He went around almost our whole call centre. Our managers told us to just hang up if we got him, his account had dozens of notes on it that just were variations on he wouldnt stop screaming so I hung up. 
What do they think is going to happen if they just scream without telling people whats wrong?~~Had a similar issue on a job site a couple months back.  The customer, the general contractor, and all the subcontractors have their own safety personnel. 

  
After being told 4 different things within a matter of weeks by different safety guys, I got fed up when 3 of them approached my foreman, saying a b c.   I immediately got down off my ladder as foreman was listening with a look of annoyance to interrupt their ...lesson?   I told them pointedly what we had just been told the week previous by X safety guy, Y safety guy said that, and Z said something completely different then followed up with they need to get their shit together.  Get all safety peoples together as a group and discuss the rules of ladder safety that they want followed (other than OSHA standards) and leave us alone until they work it out.    


If the people in charge can't work together, things just turn into a circus.~~I actually dont mind talking to people with English as a second language. Im calling because I need help and the person I called generally knows more about what I need help with. If the call rep isnt getting it, its because I talk weird (I use weird descriptions for things, talk too fast, stop mid sentence and start another without realizing any of it). I have yet to ask for a manager when making a call. And I usually end the call with I hope the rest of your shift goes well. Because Have a good day is too impersonal and meaningless.~~A call centre I worked for my colleague had a customer who refused to hang up because they wanted to talk to the manager (who wasn't there). When the call disconnected (because we had to take other calls and couldn't sit there) they called back and again refused to hang up etc etc. Fun times.~~",The commenter had to deal with a customer who refused to agree to an online banking agreement. The commenter sympathized with the customer's frustration but said they would not change the agreement. The commenter also shared a personal experience of dealing with a customer who threatened to kill the commenter's co-
19.0,"From the other side of the fence, I just had a contractor call and he was surrounded by turkeys and geese. He trying to give me serial numbers as ""OLOLOLOLOOO"" continues to sound in the background. I'm trying my very best to keep it cool but it's just so funny... Totally made my day.~~I love giving people my name when they get pissed. The name I go by and give everyone is not my legal name. I'm a trans dude, too. They're looking for a male rep that pissed them off, but they're going to find remarks from a ""female"" rep. There are so many reps, that most people don't know who tf I am. :)~~She is raging against the machine. Your company does not make it easy to cancel an account, and I understand why: the company wants the opportunity to retain as many customers as possible, regardless of how infuriating that is to customers. She is trying to skip the track that the business logic has put her on, and I don't blame her: I don't want to go to retention to have some retention agent start telling me, ""I'm just trying to understand...""~~Hey another super trained ATO operator! Im not in complaints but feel your pain  

Recently even had to get the police involved because someone wanted a compassionate release but werent eligible and ended up threatening to shoot themselves later that day if we wouldnt approve a release of $10000 of their super (which as you know isnt even on compassionate grounds, but for hardship which we cant approve anyway), that was a fun call.~~IMO this behavior is not limited to call centers. My partner works in manufacturing, and they constantly hire supervisors just because they have college degrees, and often these are external hires that don't understand the full scope of the position, and barely have management experience. On top of that these people are more concerned with saving face than being open and honest with their teams, which isn't great for morale or company culture. And they wonder why people are constantly changing jobs lol. 

I'm sorry you're going through this OP ~~I have only gotten that once, but one of the call centers I worked for had something the called the oceo or office of the ceo that that we were supposed to transfer to if they said ceo in the call. Some other reasons too, but that one is the only one I remember. But it was a special customer support group that helped only in those kinds of situations~~Had a caller once when I was working Server Support who started yelling at me as soon as I picked up the phone.

Customer:  ""Look, I know what I am doing here!  I don't need some High School drop out who makes minimum wage tellin me what to do on my server!""  

To which I reply in a calm even voice:  ""Sir, I am not a High School drop out, I am finishing a degree in Network Securities and while I am not going to discuss how much I make it is far much more than the minimum wage.  Now, do you want me to help you or would you like to continue this discussion of my work history?""  

Fixed his server in seven minutes.  ~~I swear  these people just think its fine to be like this to us and take out their bad day,or anger issues  on us. 
We should really get paid more for these types that call in and think it is ok to treat us like this.
They think they are better than us because they don't work in a call center.~~I fantasize about my last day where I work currently.

I deal with health insurance claims, benefits, eligibility &amp; they've recently made all our billing in-house, so we handle that too now.

The amount of rude ass people who think they are the only one in the world with health insurance is ridiculous. I long for the day where I can just interrupt them, and say ""I am a person too. You are treating me like I do not deserve the same respect as I am extending to you, so allow me to treat you the way you have treated me. Golden rule &amp; all.""~~Customer was threating to throw his phones(which are still under contract to his Grandmother) into a garbage can if we didn't put the phones under his own account(he was probably underage) without verifying his ID/Age and without his Grandmothers permission. 

Basically told him that I didn't care(called his bluff) and to go ahead. Explaining that there was $400 left on the contract of the two lines and that the phones were his to do with as he wanted. ~~Don't know why he went into detail. He could have just said I need to put the phone down for a minute, be right back.

Lol, I do outbound calling and it's kind of funny when I call someone and get told ""They're in the bathroom"". I really don't need to know that.~~I used to, before I was a team lead.

I then realized that the agents on my floor do nothing to deescalate if we don't push them to do so. And ya know what? 90% of the sup calls we get through the group chats end up being fine once we help the agent deescalate.

Your situation is certainly not something that I would have refused though.~~That's one thing I really like about the callcenter I work at. If a customer is going to talk to me that way, as long as I advise a supervisor what is going on, I'm clear to hang up on them for that kind of abuse. It's far from the best pay, it's frustrating work, my patience is tested on the daily, but they take really good care of us agents here.~~There's always the ""I only have a few minutes"" or some other purported time constraint, only to complain how long their calls ""always"" take with ""you people"" (due to them being on repeat, playing their greatest hits, constantly interrupting and all of the other tricks they employ to extend calls so they'll bave a ""legitimate"" complaint). They always blow through their self imposed time constraint, all the while bitching about how long everything takes. I swear it's by design so they can feel validated.~~Our process is a little different.  The supervisor listens to the call, you stay on the call for as long as you can with them. The supervisor fills out a threat assessment form and sends it to our Security team who reviews the form and the call. If they think it's viable threat the Security team then informs the police department in that callers area. For me this is to many steps. Just freaking call the police from the start and possibly save someone's life. Like we're in the line with them until the supervisor tells us to let them go. It's kind of backwards to me because if they only bring it up once to me then I guess it's not a ""viable threat"" but even once in my opinion is to much.~~This is really interesting; is there no end to the crap call center employees have to deal with???

Can someone fill me on on the circumstances of these suicide threats?  Are they people who don't want to pay their phone bill so they threaten to end it all?  Or people who really, really want that overdraft fee taken off?  Thanks!

PS  I'm still shaking my head 15 minutes after I read this~~I love the customers that start off angry but end up apologizing by the end. Some time their anger is justified and I just say ""well if I was in your situation I would be mad too no worries"" most are just mad at the situation and it's not personal. It's the rude ones who have no reason to be angry that annoy me~~The company I work for has a pretty specific procedure for our phone agents when someone threatens anything legal.

""Please provide the following number to any retained legal assistant."" Then provide it, and follow it with, ""We are no longer able to communicate with you directly. To rescind your statement, please email"" and an inbox that is checked irregularly at best. Then, they hang up, and the guest profile is flagged. Any agent who gets them on call back is to read the same script.

We're a travel related company, and I fucking hearing that script.~~This reminds me of when I was on survey review. 
There was an algorithm and team filtering the customer reviews after they called in.

First, they wanted me to call everyone back. 
Not just the ones we could help.  You brought us a broken computer, we couldn't fix it.  Now you want me to confirm we couldn't fix it?  Management relented on that one and I got to work. 

2 months later I get asked what we can do to try and prevent these from coming in.
What the hell do you want me to answer?  Do the job right the first time and hire more techs so the wait tines are shorter.~~I work for a small business we get calls asking to speak to the owner all the time my response has become what can we do for you?  Theyre never gonna get to the owner and theres even less of a chance of getting there if they refuse to give me any information about why theyre calling.~~When they ask for a manager right away, I put on my sweetest tone of voice and say:

""Of course, I'll be more than happy to get one for you. However, the managers here won't take a call unless we have a few details from you, so to save me wasting your time by going over there and coming back, if I could just get your &lt;verification details&gt; and &lt;brief description of what you're bitching about today&gt; then I'll go and get him lickety split!""

By saying that, they're happy that they're getting to talk to one, and that you're speeding up the process.~~I love it when they ask for your employee number. 

On an unrelated note, I used to work for T-Mobile when they had this advertisement where if your credit was terrible, they would trial you on a hybrid prepaid postpaid account. Make your payments on time, and after a year well convert the account. 

Well the year comes up, and top brass changed their mind. There were literally so many escalations whenever somebody asked for a sup you'd buddy jack with the guy next to you. ~~Sounds like we may work for the same company. We don't have a white board though but same 24-48hour call back and no one to do a take over bs. 

We got an email recently saying we now have to track down our tl and have them ok us putting in a request for a call back before we can put it in. It still 24-48 hours though. Usually the tl just gives it back to the rep to call the customer back letting them know whatever the tl decided~~Customer was complaining to me that we couldn't see anything wrong with the phone that she sent for repair. Her main argument as to why I was wrong was because she ""isn't stupid - my daughter even looked at it and she said it's definitely wrong""

I asked ""Well, is your daughter also a trained repair technician? No? Well, I am. Maybe you should take the advice of somebody who is well experienced and fully trained in this field.""

She just told me to stop being smart with her and continued to be obtuse and generally vile to be on the phone with.~~","The commenter had a bad experience with a contractor who was yelling at them and trying to give them serial numbers as ""OLOLOLOLOOO"" instead of their legal name. They also had a bad experience with a customer who threatened to shoot himself if they didn't release him from his contract."
19.0,"ME: ""Thank you for calling &lt;large insurance company&gt; my name is Wuornos, how may I help you?

CALLER: ""No, I don't think you can help me because I can't stand the sound of your voice, transfer me to someon--""

ME: *sees that there are 35 in the queue* I'm sorry sir, you'll have to call back and try for another agent, goodbye.
~~One of my biggest pet peeves is when the customer is demanding a supervisor and the supervisor just can't be bothered to deal with it.

Especially when the sup tells you ""oh just tell the customer such-and-such..."" It NEVER goes well. The customer just gets angrier and angrier and of course thinks I'm not doing my job properly and I'm denying them a supervisor on purpose.

As much as I want to tell the customer ""Well my supervisor doesn't want to deal with you, that's why he's not taking your call"" of course that's not an option.



~~god I hate this kind of thing. There is a clear difference between an escalated customer who is just genuinely frustrated and one who thinks they can bypass all the policies and rules by throwing a temper tantrum and bullying everyone the talk to. I bend over backwards to help frustrated customers but if you think you can get what you want by belittling and bullying me then I don't technically HAVE to even pitch reduced fees or waive anything.~~When I worked in collections, I heard that a lot. We didn't have employee numbers. We did have badge numbers but they didn't mean anything to anyone at all, they were just random numbers printed on our physical badges. People used to get so mad that I didn't have any identifying information to give them aside from my first name. They insisted that I would get fired anyways, but of course I never did. Weirdly, the company wasn't in the habit of firing us for doing our jobs.~~This reminds me of ome of my jobs. My boss and the boss of our QA team got into some kind of pissing match. I suddenly noticed furious typing from one cube. Then furious typing from the other. Back and forth. Back and forth. A few of my coworkers and I watched with mild amusement, because somehow it wasn't at all a surprise. A lot of children dressed as adults worked there.~~You are not alone. 

This seems very typical of call center manglement in general, not to mention worse things. 

I actually rarely needed their help for knowledge but their attitude was similar. 

It's like they resented ever having to do any real management work, EVER, unless it was to point out all the things you did wrong, which anyone could do. 

A mentally challenged person could manage if you just told them to observe people and then tell them what they did wrong every day. Takes no skill at all.

Get out of there as soon as you can. This will damage your mental health more than you know.~~Just curiouswhen the get to cancellations does the customer have to listen to five minutes of retention pitches?  I have to wonder how successful that is?  I bet no one has run the whole numbers on THAT.  I ran a call center for a large bank.  It cost us $4.95 to answer every call.  When I explained this after starting the jobthe bank administration got their asses in gear to change some policies.~~You fuckin' moron! Dont you know how much I fuckin spend with you guys? You wouldn't even be around if I didn't spend money with you!

Back in Aught-Nine the CEO and I used to go out and shoot dogs on his property down in Baton ROuge! I'll have you know I know the chief of police and I was an ex navy seal who helped Chris Kyl;e kill Bin Laden and have over 100 confirmed kills! You'll hear from Trump about this!!!!!!! FUCKIN MAGA!~~I deal with this type of thing *constantly* working for a bank / financial institution. I am wondering if maybe being in a call center / help desk would be better somewhere else, or if it's not this bad at different types of companies. Dealing with this type of person (there are so many of them in the financial industry) while trying to maintain my AHT is driving me towards insanity. 75% of my day is actually spent trying to negotiate with these egomaniacs, their emotional maturity level of toddlers, their endless tantrums and hissy fits etc. instead of actually fixing problems. I've tried everything but so many of them are just hell bent on being a complete pain in the ass and holding me hostage on calls.~~Im going to take a long shot and guess that whatever this customer is trying to log in to, is being restricted because their account has been accessed from country X since their account was created.  Definitely a security feature.  I bet someone needs to update their geographic preferences somewhere, whether its the customer or escalation.  

But fuck people who move to the US for a better quality of life and then bitch.~~My mother works for a small non-profit, and people are generally very nice, but occasionally she'll get some real awful callers (she takes about 95% of the calls for this place). It's very easy to find the name of the founder online, but here's the twist - his name is spelled like a very common name, but pronounced completely differently. So when people who are either really irritated or just straight up scammers call in demanding to speak to ""[common pronounciation], I know him very well and he won't stand for this!"" my mom can just deflect if possible or just hang up lmao. Yeah, you're buddy-buddy with the founder and can't even pronounce his name right? Okay, sure lol. He doesn't even show up outside of annual meetings at this point anyways, what do you think he can do?~~Depending on the campaign and the scale of the company you work for, the amount of information you're required to essentially memorise is equivalent to a few different university level modules.

If you can hold down a job in a call centre for even 6 months you're anything but slow.~~This is always the attitude of people that can't login and get irrational. 

1. they are always certain that they know their login info but the computer system is wrong(not how it works but fair enough).

2. They swear they know their login info but also don't know their security question(losing credibility on knowing stuff).

3. Usually the best moment when they can't reset the password by email because the email account they used is no longer accessible.....why? Because they don't know the login info or security questions to that account either.

Until the end they will swear they are still correct and systems are just out to screw them over.
~~Near the end of my Call Center life, when I had just given up on humanity, I took a caller like this.  My answer was ""Do you want the guy who looks over my shoulder or do you want to talk to me, who has a better chance of helping you?""  

Only once, have I gotten a call where the woman demanded a Supervisor and once I got the information she tells me what she needed.  It was an order reversal, something I had no power to control.~~Racist jerks like that are the worst. I work for a cellphone provider here in canada, I do both french and english calls. It always rubs me the wrong way when I hear ""finally somebody that speaks proper french/english""

I dont understand how people think they are ""valued"" and ""important"" to us when they cant afford being kind or to pay their own freaking bills.~~By the end of the day, I get so worn down by their bitching and first world problems, that after they are done ranting, I go right on to the next issue or ""is there anything else I can do for you""? I'm  not rude, but they end up saying ""you really don't care do you? Entitled yet observant.~~I just left this comment in another post earlier today...

I called in to a pre-paid cell provider recently and could tell this lady was working from home and lives in a rural area. I could hear lots of chickens and roosters in the background. I got a kick out of it and kinda giggled every time I heard them. She caught on to me being able to hear it all and kinda snort-laughed every time I did. It made the rather long trouble-shooting call a bit more entertaining.~~I cannot count the number of people who supposedly were going to get me fired during the 11 years I spent at my last company.  Of course, we did eventually all get laid off and the entire call centre closed but that came with a very nice pile of severance cash.  So...I guess they technically win...?~~A lot of people who try for management positions focus way too hard on the 'being in charge' aspect of leadership roles and don't understand that it's still a job and still requires effort. Unfortunately, the people who are best suited for leadership roles (supporting their coworkers, standing up to higher-ups on behalf of their team, etc.) are seldom promoted.~~I could actually cancel accounts doing wireless support for a certain red carrier. They didn't have a retention department, but they gave us a tool that had ""save offers"". I very rarely used it because by the time they've gotten on the phone with us, they already had plans to switch to Magenta or whoever. They just wanted their watch or tablet line cancelled. If they had an ETF or payoff, I would tell them, and get it over with~~One of my duties at a previous job was performing computer investigations for our legal department.   I had the number to give folks.  


""You have stated you will contact a lawyer and sue us.  On direct advise from our legal department, I can no longer communicate with you.  Please have your lawyer call {corp} Legal Dept at XXX-XXX-XXXX.   Good Day.""~~I don't work in a call center, but retail, so I also deal with customers. I work as a supervisor on the front end of a large grocery store. One evening an agitated older gentleman come up to me and asks ""is the store manager in? I need to talk to the highest ranking person in this store!"" I attempted to find out what the matter was but he insisted I get the highest ranked lesson in the building to speak with him. After a couple of pages for a manager had proved unsuccessful, I asked again what he needed help with. ""I left my wallet here about an hour ago and I need to get it back right now!"" In a matter of a minute at most, I got a description of his wallet, walked behind customer service and returned his wallet to him.~~Not a CEO but a memorable one I had one back in the day was about a Bollywood actress . The guy called in and asked for her number because he ""really liked"" her. He did not believe I didn't have it and he started screaming saying I had it but didn't want to give it to him (I am in the USA). He started doing the ""I'm going to make you loose your job"" speech. He finally hung up...  I am astonished by people. Some calls, you end it wondering how they actually function in the real world...~~",The commenter expresses frustration with customers who demand a supervisor and refuse to listen to the supervisor's explanation. They also mention their own experience of working in collections and how difficult it can be to deal with angry customers.
19.0,"Oh yes. Couple of times.

Its so funny that they are paying like 20 euros on their bill, yet they DEMAND to speak to the CEO of a multinational company because of a technical issue

Sure man, and after the CEO I will personally connect you with the head of the European Parliament just to be safe.~~Yep. 

I used to work for the complaints department of a high street bank. I was part of the head office customer complaints team, which was actually based in the NW of England. 

The amount of people that would call in, get ENRAGED they were talking to someone in the NW and not London and would then be transferred to me, because I have a London accent. 

How insulting as well to think that just because someone comes from a different area than you think HO is based then theyre not going to have the authority to refund your 10 charge?~~Lets see the Craziest. Im not sure if this is really the craziest cause i have a lot.

But i once had a guy call from Chicago. You could by his speech pattern, and words that he was very ghetto. He wanted to know ""why we was holding his license hostage.'"" I explain it was because he had tickets for driving while license revoke, speeding and so on, and he had to resolve those first before we would release our block. He get mad and calls me:

""A fucking whitebread honkey""

I'm used to being call a honkey, my circle of friends pretty much calls each other honkies all the time. So nothing new to me.

So I said "" If that is the best racist insult you have, then just go ahead and hang up"" and so he did, and he still doesnt have a license last I checked :D~~I've seen all sides of this. Worked in a call centre and did a great job, had some awesome colleagues who knew their stuff but also some who were pretty dire.

I've called in to places and talked to amazing people who've helped me right away, and some where I have literally had to spell out what they need to do next even though it's their job and should be something they do every day.

I'm always polite and patient but I can see why some people would get frustrated. There are some bad bad call centre staff out there and it's enough to ruin it for everyone else.~~I work in insurance claims. At least once a day, someone gets mad because of being found liable for an accident or we fixed their 2000 Taurus with parts that weren't new and tell me ""I am going to hire an attorney."" To which I say ""That's fine. Keep in mind that if you retain an attorney, we can no longer speak directly to you but rather to the attorney"" 9x out of 10, they never hire an attorney.

tl, dr Insurance. Attorney threats. GFY we can't talk to you~~Reminds me of a story a friend told me.

He works in a call center for $BigPhoneCompany.  
An $AnnoyingCustomer was getting really rude and started insulting him, but they're not allowed to hang up.  
$AC starts with the ""I want to cancel!"" crap.  
Friends goes ""Are you sure?"".  
$AC: ""Yes, I'm going to cancel!""  
Friends: ""Okay sir, your service has been cancelled.""  
The guy hung up while swearing loudly.~~The ""I'm gonna cancel my service!"" calls are almost always laughable because the customer would threaten to cancel for ridiculous reasons like some spoiled child who threw a fit because his parents said ""no"" to having candy for breakfast.

The icing on the cake is when they think the supervisor would cave and then they get told ""no"" again for their insane demand(s) to keep their service with the company.   I'm lucky that I've never had a supervisor cave to a customer's crazy  demands but I have to say I sympathize for retail workers since they tend to have to deal with spineless managers for crap like that. 

~~Whenever they start with ""this is what happened"" or any variation you are in for a ride.

Had to tell a lady that I just need to verify if she updated the address and all i need is a simple yes or no but she insisted on why it was changed.~~I feel you there-I've had a certain Lead tell me numerous times that, ""This isn't an escalation."" If they're screaming for a supervisor...that's an escalation. Turns out she had been denying every escalation that came her way for four weeks and now no longer works here...

It'll all come back around eventually.~~As soon as the caller brought up the ""N word"", I would have stated that I'm not going to stand for that sort of language, told the caller I'm hanging up, said goodbye and disconnected.  And if management wanted to fire me for it, by all means.  I've had that happen at other jobs, and there is *nothing* any company can do to force me to endure exposure to hate speech or racism.  If the company thinks they can, I have a lawyer who can teach them the error of their ways.  (He's done so before.)~~","The commenter, who used to work in a high-street bank's customer complaints department, expresses frustration with customers who demand to speak to the CEO of a multinational company because of a technical issue.
