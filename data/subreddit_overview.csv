It is important to note that one of the common risks associated with abstractive summarization is hallucination, which is the introduction of content not completely relevant to the source text.  Abstractive summarization is not perfect and while there are methods to check the accuracy of an abstractive summary, it is not a guarantee of accuracy.  The intent of this report is to consolidate the submissions to a subreddit over an extended period of time and group those submissions into categories identified using NLP analysis techniques.  Should some of the topics be of interest, then a further review of the original subreddit posts is recommended.  Stephen Drew, 2 April 2023."
