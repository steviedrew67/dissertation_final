0.0,"So I work in a call center. We have recorded lines. Yesterday, I had a caller who was extremely irate. He called back 5 minutes later, and then 5 minutes later again. On the third call, he threatened to go to the CEO and get me fired. They pulled the calls, and heard what he said. He had the wrong number the entire time.~~My absolute favorite type of calls are when the customer suddenly realizes how ridiculous they sound. For example today this happened when I got to the part of the verification when I have to ask for an address. Me: Can I get your full address please? Caller: [says p.o. box]. Me: I need your home address please. Caller: [repeats p.o. box]. Me: Mam I need your home address. Caller: [repeats p.o. box again indignantly]. God didn't you hear me the first two times. Me: So for the record you confirm that you live inside of a p.o. box. Caller: [realizes how ridiculous she sounds] Oh my god I can't believe I just said that three times. You must think I'm an idiot.~~I worked at a call center. We were not allowed to put people on hold. We had to use the mute button. One day I had a member call in to dispute a charge on her credit card. I asked her to hold while I reviewed her account. I hit the mute button so I could hear if she said something wrong while I was reviewing her account. I heard her say to someone in the background, ""I have another n***** on the phone."" I immediately took her off mute and told her, ""Ma'am, I heard that. You can call back."" I then hung up on her. That was the first and only time I have ever hung up on a customer.~~This call was from a while ago so I don't really remember all the boring details but it stands out to me because the guy I was talking to thought he was so clever until I used his own analogy to disprove his point. Basically, he was complaining about how our software works with Microsoft. There was an issue on their end, but he wanted us to resolve it because he can't reach Microsoft over the phone. That does not make it our problem, nor is it something we could fix even if we tried to. After some polite reiteration by me that, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do, he goes ""you guys always just wanna dump the problem on someone else. you know what that tells me?"" After a few moments of silence, I realize he is actually waiting for me to ask. ""What?"" I say in a disinterested tone. ""That's like if you're a basketball manufacturer and your ball isn't going through the hoop so you tell me to go talk to the guys that make the rims."" Kind of a weird analogy but ok.~~I work a customer service job where I answer calls about people's issues with the company I work for. I answer these calls calmly and professionally despite the fact that I get yelled at on a daily basis by customers. I am a very sensitive person and I have a hard time handling getting yelled at. I have applied to over 100 places in the last 2 years and haven't gotten a single interview. I make minimum wage and I have lots of health issues but no health insurance. My cat is dying and I can't afford to take him to the vet. I have so much going on in my life and I take it out on nobody except the people who yell at me over the phone. Today, after getting yelled at for the umpteenth time, I finally snapped. I told the woman who was yelling at me to either start treating me better or I would put her back in the queue and she would have to wait on hold again. She immediately apologized and thanked me for my help. I felt great giving it right back to her.~~I worked in a call center for a major US wireless carrier. This was before my promotion to glorified manager (escalations). The day was like any other, we were fairly slow when I get a call from a woman asking about strange charges on her bill. I verify. She's authorized on the account and I start going over the strange charges, pay per view, etc. I don't have a hold button just mute, and I was going to place her on a brief hold while I asked my supervisor about some charge I had never seen. That's when hell breaks loose. Mind you I'm hearing everything going on. Normally I would hear stuff like talking to friends or even the occasional bathroom visit. Nothing prepares me for this. I hear a shout and a bunch of curse words aimed at my caller. Then I hear what sounds like a slap then something being thrown.~~I work in a call center. Today, I got a call from a woman who provided her account number. I pulled up the account and asked who I was speaking with. I was caught off guard with her response. Were going to use cl here, which obviously has to stand for crazy lady. 

cl: well, ill tell you who i really am because my dad said i could 

me: ok... what is your name please?~~My first job was at a homegoods/clocks store. It was slow as hell and I didn't make much money. On Friday nights, this older man would call and we would talk about nothing for hours. He became my friend. Two years later, I was laid off. I think about him all the time.~~This happened about a year ago. I worked for a cell phone company, my job was mostly to take care of splitting accounts in case of a divorce or a son/daughter going to live on their own. so this gentleman calls informing us that he got divorced and since he owns the account, he wants to authorize his ex to get her number out of it. usually i just place a note on the acc and thats it, but he asked me to call her to get it done right away. and so this circus ensued. d1: dude 1, d2: dude 2, d3: dude 3 (my favourite).~~A Comcast customer service representative allegedly hung up on a Spanish-speaking woman after she cursed at him. The woman called to complain that her bill was too high. When the rep could not help her, she started yelling and cursing. The rep warned her twice to stop using profane language, or he would drop the call. He dropped the call, and the woman continued to yell at him.~~Me: Hi, how can I help you today? Customer: I've been waiting on the phone for 45 minutes. Me: I'm sorry for the wait. Customer: I was promised a callback and I'm not getting it. Me: I will help you with your problem. Customer: During our conversation I'm swearing a lot. Me: I don't care. Customer: I also hate people. Me: I hate people too.~~This story was shared on Facebook by a woman who works in customer service. It's a story about a customer who screamed and yelled at an employee. The customer was unkind and said things that were unnecessary and uncalled for. The employee couldn't handle the situation and had a panic attack. This story is a reminder to be kind to customer service representatives. They are humans too and they don't deserve to be treated badly.~~John Smith has a charge on his account that he believes is fraudulent. Mary, who was transferred in from another department, needs his account number to help him. John refuses to give her the number. Mary will get her supervisor if John doesn't give her the number. Nothing happens.~~Working in a call center is hard. You get some very bad calls. They range from stupidity to annoying and even down right horrible. I understand why my friend used the mute button to curse customers out. But it is not professional. And he never listened to me when I told him not to do it.~~My last job before I decided to go solo was as customer support for a telecommunications company. I took that job because I needed flexible hours. I worked a lot of nights and got a lot of weird calls, usually from drunk people. This is the weirdest call I have ever received.~~A man phoned a financial aid department where I work. He was on hold. He started playing our hold music on his piano. I got a good laugh.~~caller wants to speak to ___'s manager immediately. caller was speaking with her and she hung up on her. me explains that it's not an excuse, they're experiencing some technology issues. caller wants to speak to her manager. provides details and connects her to the person she was complaining about.~~A guy took my call for technical support. I asked him to put me through to one of his female colleagues. He said they weren't available and asked for my company name and my name. I gave him the information and he typed it in. Then, he asked me to describe the technical issue. I did. Then, he told me I type pretty fast for a man. I thanked him and he seemed to soften.~~I work in a call center. A woman called me, Mrs. Toth. She wanted to speak to a case worker, Mr. Englmaier. I couldn't connect her to him, but I could connect her to his proxy, Mrs. Teufl. She was silent for a few seconds and then asked me laughing: So, I want to speak to an angel, but you can only offer me a devil?~~Never, ever prank call a crisis line. It's a federal crime. We always know. And it's not funny.~~I worked at a gift experience company - in my first week there a very elderly lady called, she was incredibly hoarse and as a newbie to phones i was struggling to understand her. 

she was after a song maker experience, where you go to a studio and have a song professionally recorded. after a long chat explained she was due to have surgery to remove her vocal chords due to cancerous cells, and started crying about how much she loved to sing and wanted to remember the sound of her own voice. 

i was in training at this point, and being supervised. phone lady asked if id like to hear her sing, my trainer got everyone in the office to dial in to my line to give her an audience. she sang an incredibly croaky but ever so sweet version of somewhere over the rainbow. it was a really lovely moment, and she was so grateful (the office gave her a round of applause).~~Once upon a time, before the wildcats came to Mossflower, a younger and far more innocent (and much prettier) me was working in a call center. After barely three hours sleep, I stumbled in to the office, logged in to my computer and opened the phone lines. Almost immediately the phone rang. I stared, it was 0630, who the hell buys toy soldiers at 0630?!","If you cuss before you tell me why, I'm hanging up.~~I swear I’m not usually this dumb: when the caller suddenly becomes self aware~~The mute button is not the customers friend~~Customer loves his analogy until I use it against him~~Finally cracked on a caller.~~Beat you’re spouse we call the police.~~My father is the president of the United States of America!~~Saddest call ever~~Customer's ex-wife's coworker quits his job due to my call~~Just for the record I can understand you~~Wait before you go... ""I hate you..."" ""I hate you to ma'am.""~~So I'm going to rant.~~Customer said he was going to get me fired for asking to get his account number~~Don’t Use That Mute Button~~[NSFW] I'm pretty sure that's not how phone sex works~~The customer put me on hold...~~Struggling to have sympathy for callers who are jerks during this crisis.~~Put me through to one of your female colleagues!~~when death calls to speak with an angel and gets connected to a devil ;)~~Don't prank call crisis lines for sexual pleasure!~~Somewhere over the rainbow..~~A Moment of perfect Existential Dread.","I work in a call center.

0.0,"I worked in a call center for a new online bank. I had just been hired and was still in training. We were understaffed because of the holidays. A man called in to sort out something on his bank account. I fixed it for him no problem. Then, he asked if he could do the same thing on his wife's account. I explained that since his name was not on the account, he could not make any changes or access information about it. The man was frustrated, but eventually gave in. I started to sign off, happy to get to lunch on time, when suddenly, I was interrupted...~~Customer called at almost midnight, obviously drunk, and irate about the fact that his golden oldies movie channel was saying he was not subscribed. **oh no**! world ending trauma right, folks! how on *earth* can he reminisce about the good old days, when men were men and women were scared of them, without access to the wonderful world of black and white movies??? 

he started things off by ranting that someone was gonna owe him money for 'taking away his movies', and then refusing to confirm his identity, all while yelling and swearing incoherently.~~Michael is trying to do a medical claim for his daughter's treatment refund. He cannot sign into the website. The whole time Michael is talking, he is giving Michael small talk. Michael gives him his DOB, name, and security question number/phrase. Michael was born in 1941. The caller was sounding significantly younger.~~A few weeks ago I received a call from a famous British Olympic runner. He wanted to talk to a manager because he failed our security questions. I asked my manager if he would speak to him, but my manager said no. The runner got angry and started calling me every name under the sun. I told him that I would now be terminating the call as I don't appreciate being spoken to like that. He then told me that he has my name and will be reporting me.~~I used to work as a salesperson for a popular cable tv service. it was a miserable job, i absolutely hated it. but i had a customer one night that really stuck with me. 

it was about 8pm on a weeknight, and i had a man call in wanting to set up service. he was an old man, i believe in his 80s. i was trying to set up service for him, and of course he derails a little. but we don't get dinged for call time, so i was all too willing to just let him talk.~~A selection of stories from users of this site.~~Miss Carter complains about the service. She does not like the fact that the employee addressed her by her first name. She also does not like the fact that the employee sort of half yelled at her.~~I work in a call center. I use the same greeting 40 times a day so it's safe to say I've got the pace and tone on lock and I sound professional af. Usually it's well received, but there's a small problem. I sound nothing like my company's automated system, yet customers ask me if I'm a recording several times a day. It's gotten to the point where I've had people hang up and call back when I'm trying to verify the account.~~Customer: You should do that for work! You'd be great at one of those 1-900 numbers!

Agent: I'd make an exceptional phone hooker.

Customer: His wife yells, Isnt that for those sex hotlines?!

Agent: Oh, no, I'd make an excellent psychic.~~Brandon Smith is angry because he was hung up on 3 times. I need to talk to his father, Ryan Smith. Ryan Smith is not on the account. Ryan Smith's ex-wife, Mary Taylor is on the account. Mary Taylor is not available. Brandon Smith is 14 years old.~~Working in technical support isn't always the easiest job. We get yelled at, sworn at, and sometimes even threatened. It's not the most pleasant job but someone's got to do it, right? Well, we do our best to help customers and fix their problems. Some customers, however, make it very difficult to help them.~~A guy called my work's tech support line. He was paranoid and spoke to only female representatives with high pitched voices. He threatened to shoot up the building and kill everyone in it. I got him to give me his insurance number and hung up. The next day I got called to HR and a Secret Service officer interviewed me. I got $50 for my troubles.~~Customer service. We've all been there, done that. Some of us on a daily basis. And while most of the time it's just a minor annoyance, sometimes it can turn into a major headache. Like the time I had to deal with an irate customer who just wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise. But hey, that's just part of the job, right? Right.~~I will never apologize again. It's been six months and I'm still going strong. When a customer complains or whines about some triviality I either treat them to dead silence or I segue on to my next point without even acknowledging what they've said. It's a surprisingly disarming practice and I wish my colleagues would summon some dignity and join me!~~A customer is calling because he has a problem. He is rude and doesn't want to talk to me. He requested a supervisor. I put him on hold and called my manager. My manager is also rude and doesn't want to talk to the customer. The customer is a jerk.~~Customer: Hi, I have a problem with my cable service. I got a promotion which gave me two movie channels free for two years. I can only renew one of them at no charge, and remove the other if I don't want to pay. I don't want to remove either of them. The customer service representative refuses to help me and is being very difficult.~~I've taken so many calls where I have to tell a customer no. Usually they don't like it, which I get. You're calling to hear a yes. What bothers me is that as soon as you tell a customer no, they think you're an idiot. They never just take it. And I always make sure to tell the customer why the answer is no, so they can understand it. But so many times it goes along the lines of this: m: I'm sorry, but because of point a and b, we can't honor your request. c: Uhmm... hmm. Are you sure? m: Yes sir/Yes ma'am. c: But *repeats the whole story again*. m: Yes I understand, but unfortunately this doesn't change the answer. c: Maybe you should check with someone with more knowledge than you. m: No ma'am/sir, I am 100% sure of the answer I just gave you. c: Oh yeah? well I will call back tomorrow, maybe I can get someone else on the phone who does know how to help me with my problem which is totally my own fault but I still blame your company for.~~I work in a council taking phone calls regarding neighbourly nuisances and the like. I don't have any specific stories of 'special calls' but I am routinely on the phone recently for 20-30 minutes for what are essentially 5 minute calls. I did have one lady crying, screaming, weeping and otherwise just breaking down to me on the phone because, and I quote ""I just can't take it. They're on that damn thing for up to an hour every single day, it's driving me mad!"" This is in reference to her neighbours causing a 'horrendous noise nuisance' from their kids being on trampolines. Bear in mind this lady lives 4 doors away from the person she's complaining about. I'm guessing the rest of you guys are getting it bad too but this whole covid-19 business has turned everyone on the phones into absolute messes.~~A customer calls in to complain about the service they received. They want to speak to a manager. The customer was informed that the warranty doesn't cover cracks on the tv panel. The customer is not happy with the answer and wants a replacement or a refund. The customer was disconnected.~~Me and a lady I was working with were on hold with a company. The company had a hold due to some kind of mass failure that has prompted every one of their customers to call in and figure out whats going on with their life savings. I told her I would be happy to wait with her as long as the hold didnt become excessive. During our hold, a nice sounding lady would break through the hold music and say something like, your call is important to us, all of our representatives are assisting other callers. Please continue holding and a representative will be with you shortly. The lady I was working with then responds to the recording saying oh thank you, im ready to get this over with. I keep my laughter from coming out the first time it happened, but the second time when she responded to the exact same recording with, im not sure if I believe you, its starting to take a while I could not hold it in and had to use the mute button for what god made the mute button for, laughing at people that dont use the computer and have to call in the first place.~~Caller rings because they have a problems claiming on our online system. He literally screams at me,: your system says my claim is to old!!!! It was two days ago! I ask him to read the format of the date out loud to me. Him: claim date ...zero eight zero one two zero one nine!!! Two days ago!! How is that too old?!?! I knew the mistake he had done. We always get these calls in the early part of January.~~Sometimes the best part of a person's day is a random, heartwarming phone call. This thread is for those stories. Whether it's a wrong number that turned into a chat session or a call with an irate customer that ended pleasantly, we want to hear your stories. And hey, if you're a jerk who likes to mess with people, we want to hear about that too.~~I work in a call center. I've been contemplating quitting for months now and I was about to quit tomorrow but I think I might as well do it now. I wrote my manager an email explaining this, we shall see what she says!~~My favorite sales call ever was a few years ago when I worked for a cell company. I got a call from an old man who wanted to change his privacy settings. He did not know how to do it, so I offered to help him. We figured out that his settings were on private. I did not sell him anything, but I made his day.~~I work in a call center. Today, I had a customer who was angry about the answer I gave her. She started cussing me out and calling me every name in the book. She told me I don't care about helping her and even threatened to find a way to tell Donald Trump. I tried to speak, but she cut me off to scream some more. She continued doing this for 20 minutes.~~I worked in a call center for 20+ years. My favorite story is about a customer who called to pay for an invoice with a credit card. He started chatting about his mother and her hips, how light bulbs are made, his job, etc. After 45 minutes he said, ""Okay, well, I'll talk to you soon, love you!","So you won't let me access my wife's account? Be my sugar baby~~That time I thought I was out of a job for calling a customer a ""twat""~~How to trick your caller to accidentally telling the truth~~I don't care if you're a celebrity~~This conversation still sticks with me two years later.~~Idiot irate customer gets comeuppance~~“Refer to me as Miss Carter from now on.”~~""Sir, you reached the human, not another robot.""~~“You should work for a 1-900 number”~~Probably the weirdest calll I've had in my short career.~~Joys of the mute button~~Guy threatens government agency and I get $50 for speaking with the secret service.~~I only did exactly as she asked.~~I've stopped apologizing~~I won't talk to someone from a f... farm.~~just got off the phone with the smartest man in the world aka “ken from the cape”~~So many people seem to think we're idiots~~Corona has made working phones a living hell~~I'm not getting off the phone until I speak to a manager~~Customer responds to automated system telling them that all representatives are busy assisting other customers &amp; Your Call is important to us.~~January dated caller (cross post)~~Sweet caller warmed my cold, dead call centre heart~~Told a customer to suck a dick~~My favorite call ever.~~It's amazing how awful people are when you're very nice, but can't give them the answer they wanna hear.~~Thanks, I love you too!","I worked in a call center for a new online bank.

When my friend picked up the phone, the caller asked: ""Danielle, you sound hot, what are you wearing right now?"" My friend, who was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, replied: ""No, I said my name is David, and nothing big stud."" The man immediately hung up the phone.~~I got a call today from the ""IRS Tax Court"". The guy told me that there was a large discrepancy in my taxes for the years 2012-2018. A total of $8200 in deductions were fraudulent. I intentionally lied on my taxes, who doesn't? But it was only for $2000, I didn't intentionally defraud you guys for over $8000! I'm a CPA (I'm not, obviously).~~even_appeal is a company that organizes events. caller made a donation to one of those events. caller wants to know what happened to the money.~~I worked in a call center for a major credit card company for a little over two years. It was a mixed bag, some good some bad. The good: I got to talk to some famous people. Tommy Lee, Pamela Anderson, and Kid Rock (who was surprisingly nice) were the big ones. I also got to talk to some people who were clearly in the throws of a mental breakdown, which was interesting in its own way. The bad: The job was extremely monotonous and I was underpaid. Also, the turnover rate was ridiculous, I think I went through four different teams in the two years I was there.~~My coworker has the day off. The other four are out due to being sick.

One of the most notable changes is how we communicate with each other. With more people working from home and using technology to stay connected, it's no surprise that the number of phone calls has increased. But have you noticed that the quality of phone calls has decreased? It seems that people are becoming less civil and more impolite.~~i work for a promotional advertising printing company. we are currently in our busy season for calendar orders. we deal with distributors who have customers of their own that they (in a way) outsource their work to us in certain situations. heres how this call went: m - me

m - wow i have no words for that

m - (to myself) wow im going to hell

background: i work for a promotional advertising printing company.~~A former call center employee shares a story about a bizarre quality assurance policy. Apparently, this person was taking a call from the customer, answering his question, when he interrupted me with, ""are you a human? you sound like a \[redacted\] robot."" I assured him that I am not a robot and we continued the call. After it was finished I went to my manager so she would know about it. I told her how I was somewhat angry with the caller, because I am careful to modulate my voice, and vary my speaking speed so as not to sound monotone or bored. She agreed that I had a good phone voice and told me not to let the caller get to me.~~I work in a call centre. I have a deep voice and often get mistaken for a man over the phone. This has never been a problem until today. I was helping a customer who was being very difficult and kept asking me to confirm my identity. I told him I was a woman and he did not believe me. He asked to speak to my manager and I transferred the call. My manager came on the line and he actually apologised to her for me sounding the way I did.~~A call comes in to the support center. The caller is irate and threatening. He has called several times and each time he has been abusive to the agents. He has called one of the female agents a ""dumb cow.""  The supervisor takes the call and the agent off the phone. Two weeks later, the supervisor asks the agent if she remembers the call. The caller has called several companies and has been abusive to their agents as well. The supervisor tells the agent that the CEO of the company wants to talk to the caller. The CEO gets on the phone and in two minutes the CEO tells the caller that any other threats, calls to the support center, or calls to third parties about this will be met with the full legal power of the company and he would advise against lying to our support staff or abusing anyone again or there will be consequences. There was a few seconds of stunned silence and a click and they never heard from the caller again.~~Sometimes, when dealing with an angry customer, you have to let them know that they are not getting their way. Sometimes, you have to be the bad guy. It's not fun, but someone has to do it.~~I work in a call center. I have a pretty monotone voice when I'm on the phone. I also start taking calls very early in the morning, so sometimes I'm a bit sleepy on the phones when I first clock in. I just had a call that I thought went okay. When it was time to end the call, the customer said, ""Wow, that's someone who hates their job."" She then proceeded to call me bitter and miserable. Like, what did you want, an annoyingly chipper voice at 8:00 am? It caught me off guard a little because I always talk like this on the phone and there is never a problem. I know I shouldn't care, but what would make a person say that after a three minute conversation over the phone?~~A woman working at a call centre shares the unsettling experience of receiving a call from a stranger who knew her location and started asking for her number. She was not allowed to hang up and so had to flag down her supervisor to take the call. The man became angry when he realised he had been overheard and said some racist things before hanging up. The woman says she is now paranoid that the man is outside the building.~~Mr C is calling escalated support. He wants to talk to im_mr_b only. He doesn't like that he can hear other people talking in the background. im_mr_b tells him it's a call center. Mr C wants im_mr_b to stand up and tell other people to be quiet. im_mr_b refuses to do it. Mr C agrees to email support.~~A frustrated IT support worker has posted a rant on Reddit in response to customers who abuse him over the phone. The post has since received more than 18,000 up-votes. See also: How to talk to IT support without being a d**k. (Warning: contains strong language).~~This person called in and wanted me to look up a provider. I said okay, whats the providers name. She was like oh wait a minute I lost my list. She spent 5 minutes looking for this paperwork with the providers name on it. When she returned she realized she had the wrong papers so I held on. She finally found them. She had a very raspy voice so it was hard to understand her. When she spelled the providers name, I searched it and nothing came up. She kept repeating that it was a clinical social worker, and I said I heard her the first time but since nothing was coming up I would need to do it manually.

It was a rather boring job, but I did get to talk to some interesting people every once in a while. One day I got a call from a very nice woman who told me she wanted to improve her service. So I pull it up, and see the name on it, and recognize it. Let's just say the initials were M.H., and that it was somewhere on the West Coast.

She needs money to help pay for the funeral. The bank can offer a loan or a credit card but, as she is a retired pensioner, that is not possible. However, the woman has paid an extra $10,000 into her home loan. The bank can take that money, plus a small $25 fee. The intern waives the fee.

In a post on Facebook, the man, who used to work in a call centre 11 years ago, described how he got a call from a man who seemed like he was another ""Joe"". The man was very chatty and didn't ask him to check anything on his account. He started talking about times and locations and a target, and essentially nonchalantly said he was going to blow up a government building. Unsure of how to handle the situation, he signalled his supervisor and muted himself while the guy was talking. He had to get as much information out of the guy as he possibly could without raising too much suspicion. Once the guy ended the call, he was given a number for the FBI in the city the man was located in. He had to detail the whole conversation to the FBI agent and provide all the guy's personal information. He never heard anything after that, and there was never anything on the news, so he guess they got him?~~Hi everyone.

Enjoy!~~I work for a major credit card company, in the fraud department. basically, we send out fraud alerts for suspicious transactions and people call in to let us know if theyre valid or not, or they call us when they notice unauthorized transactions on their card. several times a day, I have the following call: Me: Hi, this is Lucythelumberjack from credit cards charge verification group, &lt;insert verification here&gt; Elderly caller: I have a charge for xx.xx from insert incredibly sketchy name here, and I never made that charge Me: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that! I see that they billed you fourteen days ago for x.xx. Is it possible that you signed up for a free trial, or something where you only had to pay shipping? Elderly caller, every single time: Well yes but I never authorized them to bill me further! Me: (Sigh) In the fine print of a lot of those websites, you'll find that they're actually enrolling you in a subscription program. Have you tried contacting them to cancel your subscription? Elderly caller: No, I want to dispute it as fraud.~~My customer called me today asking why his credit card was closed out. I explained it to him that his cc was inactive since 2019 and was closed back in 2020. He answered back to me that I closed his account because he's a Trump supporter. I'm from the Philippines so I have no opinion regarding US politics. I'm not biased.~~I worked in a call center for a bank for four years. This story is about one of the calls I got. It was late in the day, and the calls were slowing down. I get a call from an older guy who was probably 60, give or take. As it goes, I'm me, caller is tg (this guy). The conversation went a little something like this: tg: Hi, I have a question about my bank account. Me: Sure. What is your question? tg: Yeah, I live in Local-Washington-MT, and my bank branch is a ways away.  I was wondering, in the even of the mountain erupting, or an atomic bomb hitting, how will I get my money? Me: Oh, uh, I really don't know. tg: Why don't you know? Me: Well, sir, to be honest, if there was an atomic bomb hit, money is really going to be the last thing I would think of o worry about.~~Yesterday, I discovered, much to my dismay, that I lost my credit card. Where it wandered off to, I have no idea. The how it went missing was quickly solved with the discovery of a rather large hole in the card slot of my cell phone case. But I digress. After a few minutes of panicked account checks to make sure all was ok, I relaxed and called my bank.~~A former bank worker has revealed the hilarious moment a customer refused to accept she had given the wrong bank account number.

This is a story about a customer who was a victim of a scam. He was concerned because he thought someone had accessed his online banking. I asked him some questions to figure out what was going on.

I reset his password, confirmed it, and reviewed his account. I sent an email to our fraud department and froze his account.~~I work in a call centre for a big UK based bank. Yesterday I was on the late shift, and get a call at about 8pm - it was the mother of the account holder, asking me to block her son's debit cards for security. He had rung her to say that he'd arrived at a house party, and had his wallet stolen from his jacket (his phone had been in his jeans) which had contained his two banks cards and about 300 cash. I'll certainly block the cards so that no one can use them, but I'll need to speak to the account holder before I can reissue new debit cards, so if he could give us a call himself at his earliest convenience we'll arrange that.~~This is a transcript of a call that a customer made to the bank's fraud department. The customer had a business credit card that was in arrears (missed payments after missed payments) and had just talked to a department to arrange a payment plan to set up a monthly direct payment from his current account (I think Americans call it a checking account?) to pay off his business credit card. Shortly after the call had ended with the other department re regular payments from his current account he received an email. That told him when his next bill date was. how much would be taken. I knew this because I've been in banking for quite a while. But this guy? On a whole other level. He thought it was a scammer. And so instead of ringing back the department he was talking to previously, he ""called a trusted number on a different phone just to be sure"" (yes, he actually said that).~~I worked in a bank that dealt with people behind on payments for retail services. One of the more common things I felt with were past dues on American Express cards. Anyway, I get this lady on the phone who is irate because our automated system won't accept her payment.

Anyway, I tell her I can use a debit card or bank account info for the payment, she says card and I pull up my screen to process it through... declined 

she loses her mind screaming about how dare we decline her card she has been a customer for years etc.. she goes on and on and finally says when I got this card you said it would be accepted anywhere American Express is accepted and thats everywhere and now you are declining me. I sat there a second looked at the card number she provided and then at her account number.... same number.

This would be reported to the credit bureaus after 30 days without a payment after the first deferral.~~Thedahlelama is trying to help deafcustomer with his credit card statement. deafcustomer is angry because he believes thedahlelama owes him money. thedahlelama explains how credit cards work. deafcustomer will send a bill to thedahlelama. thedahlelama's supervisor will tear up the bill and discard it.~~Karen doesn't have her card available and doesn't want to give out her Social Security number.

I pull up the account and it is past due for 10 days. Now, the bank I work for, if the account is past due the card is still active for a few days, but if you don't even make the payment for about a week or so, the card is suspended until you pay the past due min. and of course you get notified. Conversations goes as follows: Customer: ""Why is my card blocked?"" Me: ""Unfortunately the account is past due, we did not receive any payment for the amount due last week"" Customer: ""Yes I know, I didn't pay it but I was still able to use my card."" Me: *explains the abovementioned process.* Customer: ""No one told me that.

I don't want to be tied to the company itself because I don't want to get in trouble for talking about it. Our company name blatantly has ""tutoring"" in the name.

I've just started responding with ""Yes, Succeed Online Tutoring Services is a tutoring company that offers tutoring and tutoring services to people who need tutoring to get through their classes.""

I'm contacting the Better Business Bureau!~~I work as an ATM incident manager. Yesterday, I got a call that one of the ATMs froze and stayed frozen even after a reboot. I saw that the memory was around 92-93% used. This is highly unusual, since the ATMs memory should be only between 15-25% used. I asked them to pull the logs for me. I couldn't recognize most of the files. I soon noticed the .exe file for launching assassins creed. That's when I noticed that the logs are mostly game files. I called the technician who last did a manual installation on the ATM. He remembered and said that, during the manual installation of a software that enables certain remote updates on an ATM, he accidentaly moved all files from his thumb drive into the machine and not just the installation files. He just left everything there and thought that no issues would occur. However, the ATMs memory was almost full and it couldnt receive updates, which caused the unit to freeze after a few months.","Yes Mrs Customer, I do need your full SSN~~Stupidest customer ever?~~Ma'am, I'm pretty sure big banks don't do that either...~~A gentleman wanted to brag to a scammer.~~Lady, you should probably talk to your son...~~Customer: You Tell Me The Answer And I'll Tell You If It's Right~~“You said it’s accepted anywhere”~~The perils of joint accounts~~Caller turned on me QUICK~~“I’ll just bill you.”~~""Thank you SOOO much for your 'helP'.""~~Using a counterfeit card paid off~~Customer gets mad that I say ""Walmart""~~Why did you reject my check??~~I didn't know so therefore, I shouldn't have to pay~~""I am not paying form something I am not using"" ....

He acknowledged that I wasn't in the position to override this, so naturally he asked if we could override it. I told him politely that it wasn't possible and it's the way the system we have is made to prevent fraudulent payments.

I was over $50k a few months ago &amp; its only at $20k now. I explain how the limit can be adjusted by the head of the account. Well im the president of the company &amp; I was at $50k. This makes no sense. I show you as a card holder on the account, but not as the head of the account. Youre not answering my question. Why was I able to spend $50k last month?~~Bank Manager: I work at a popular online bank as a ""manager"" aka I'm the guy you get when you want to speak to a manager. I received a request from a woman calling in requesting we waive 17 of her overdraft fees. Her justification was that she transferred funds into the account, the fees came from $4-$10 charges, she was on vacation, she had plenty of money in her other account and that she's a ""hard working person who won't let someone take what's hers."" I went on to explain I can only waive so many due to her requesting we waive fees last month, which we did, 8 of them in fact, and that we have limits on the number of fees we can waive. I waived 8 of her fees. She then demanded I waive the other 9 and refused to accept that we cannot.~~Customer calls in because her debit card has been closed due to fraud. She needs it reinstated so she can get her Plan B at the pharmacy. I explain that once a card is closed it cannot be reopened. She threatens to sue us for child support after the baby is born.~~A call centre worker has shared the ridiculous exchange he had with a customer who was having trouble accessing her monthly statement. The customer was using Microsoft Edge on a tablet, which was defaulting to the mobile version of the site. The call centre worker tried to explain that she could only access the statements through the desktop version of the site. The customer became increasingly irate and demanded to speak to the call centre worker's supervisor.~~I work in food service. We have a computer system that automatically hides groups of numbers after you put in your card. For example, 1234 **** 9123 **** would show up on the screen as 1234 9123. Most of our customers have no idea that we can't see their entire card number. They will just rattle off 16 digits without stopping. I always ask them to repeat the numbers to me four at a time. Some get annoyed and ask why I need them to do that.~~I work for a financial institution. A customer calls in all upset because he couldn't withdraw a large amount in a cash withdrawal from his credit card. Our cards do let customers do cash withdrawals but not necessarily large ones. It depends on what your limit is and other factors too. This customer purchased new windows, they were already installed and the company was understandably expecting payment. For whatever reason the company didn't take credit cards, only cash.~~A former banker has shared a hilarious call he had with a customer who was confused about her bank balance. The woman called the bank believing she had been the victim of fraud. However, after going through the transactions the banker discovered the woman had spent almost all of the money she had received from a settlement. The woman became increasingly angry as the banker explained the charges. She refused to listen to reason and the banker was forced to end the call.~~A bank worker has shared an unpleasant exchange they had with an angry customer. The post has since gone viral on Reddit. In the thread, the bank worker explains that the customer was trying to make a transfer but did not have the right level of security in place to do so. The customer became increasingly angry and threatening. The bank worker remained calm and professional throughout.~~A customer called because he lost his credit card. I was taking his information to locate his account when suddenly there was an earthquake. This was the first time it happened while I was on a call and I didn't know how to react. I muted the phone and asked my supervisor what should I do. He told me to tell the customer there was an emergency and advice him to call later. I said there was an earthquake and I needed to get out of the building. The customer disconnected the call.~~Customer service. The worst part of any industry. I hate it more than anything else in the world. I absolutely cannot stand it. I would rather do literally anything else. I would rather be set on fire and pushed into traffic while listening to Nickelback than have to deal with customer service. I know I am not alone in this.~~I work in fraud at a bank. Today I got a call from an angry 70 year old man. His lawyer had found that he had been getting fraudulently charged for several items for about 7 years. Totaling several thousand of dollars, and detailing thousands of charges. This man the contacted his lawyer, instead of coming to us the bank. Our policy is we will investigate any charge as long as we are provided date, amount and merchant. He filed a partial case in august, and requested his statements for the last ten years. He then mailed all of the fraudulent charges to an address he found online( not even an accurate address) , instead of calling an asking for the proper address. Today he is upset that no one has contacted him about the claim. I offer to take the claim by phone, for each transaction. He refuses and goes on a tirade about how poorly hes been treated ( hes called twice at this point and admitted he was treated nicely those two times) and how i can just give him a straight answer. No, i cant take your word for it and refund your money. Then the thinly veiled threats of legal action, reporting to ftc, his senators and the us attorney.~~I used to work for a credit card company. Data protection is a big thing. With credit cards it's even more of a big deal. This lady (we'll call her Karen) calls up about 20 minutes before we close. 

Me: Good afternoon, thank you for calling [credit card company] you're speaking to Op, can I take your 16 digit credit card please?

Karen (k): Yes its xx

m: Ok can you just confirm the name on the account. (At this point I can see that it definitely was not her account. It was the same surname but with data protection, I can't tell her anything about the account unless she passes data protection.)

k: thats the thing, this letter arrived with this number on but its not my number and I am the only one who has a credit card with you.

m: I see, unfortunately I can't tell you anything about the account unless data protection is passed.

This goes on for 45 minutes. I'm the last person there. Me and one supervisor.~~Customer: Hi there, do you guys do conceal and carry permits? Me: Uuuh, we're [company], the credit card company, we don't really do that... Customer: Really? You're number's on this flyer. Me: Ok, it's probably a misprint, we don't advertise with flyers nor do we issue conceal and carry permits. Customer: Well how 'bout that! You know where I can get one? Me: I could google it? Customer: Nah, that's alright! Jim's got a guy! Click.~~M works in a UK business banking call centre. Yesterday, S called M. S didn't input his customer number into the system, so M couldn't access S's account details. M asked S for his full name. S was angry and hung up.~~Karen wants to raise a fraud claim. Karen has made several card payments to bingo from 03/04/2019 through to 10/05/2020. These payments were made as a subscription basis. Karen is not happy with the answer.

The bank is waiving wire fees due to COVID-19. The customer doesn't want to pay the wire fee. He is disconnected.~~Mildred wants to dispute a charge. Emerald-Avenger needs the date of the transaction. Mildred doesn't remember the date.   Emerald-Avenger finds the transaction with the information Mildred did provide.~~Yesterday, I had a man call up to complain that the website ""doesn't work, I was told I would find xyz here but there's nothing here!"" He sounded older so we are told to always start with the basics with elderly customers with web problems so I asked him what he could see displayed on his screen. He replied that it said ""Page Not Found Connection Error"". I replied ""Hmm it sounds like there may be an issue with your internet connection, if not it could be a 404 error or of it could be that our site had gone down but we need to check everything else before jumping to the site going down because it causes a lot of grief for everyone when it goes down.~~A friend of mine used to work in a bank call center. She said there was a couple who called wondering why there were so many transfers out of a joint account. The husband got on the phone and gave his info. She traced the withdrawals to one specific account that was just his. The account was called ""side piece wendy"". She heard the couple start arguing because clearly the wife knew of ""wendy"" or suspected something.~~I worked in a bank contact center for a little over a year. The following are some of the more memorable calls I took.

There was the guy who called me saying he was racially discriminated against because the physical bank banned him and had him arrested for threatening to shoot up the bank. I apologized to him and told him there wasn't anything I could do other than filing a complaint. He then threatened to shoot up the bank.

I had multiple customers call multiple times saying things like I need to dispute a fraudulent charge I made and I want to file a dispute for a fraudulent charge. I put my card information in and said they could charge me but I didn't know they'd charge full price.

I had a girl in her early 20s call and said, verbatim, I know I overdrafted my account but I don't know why I was charged an overdraft fee.

I had an older lady called asking for the number for her local DMV. I told her I would not be able to provide it because I am not part of a local DMV. She then asked me if I could transfer her to her local DMV.~~A month in and I'm already regretting it. I need the money to survive but I hope you feel my frustrations as you're reading this tale.

1.0,"I work in a call centre. We have recently updated our payment system to increase security for customers. This means that we can no longer take card payments over the phone as the customer has to type in their card details. Some customers are unhappy with this. Today I spoke to an accountant who was furious that I could not take his card payment over the phone. He did not believe me when I explained that the system does not allow me to do this. He was also angry that I could not put him through to a manager as he is an accountant and knows what is acceptable.~~c calls m to ask why her zelle transfer isn't instant. m reviews the account and sees that c's debit card isn't connected to the account she's using for zelle. c has a card for that account but hasn't activated it. m helps her activate the card. c still doesn't have a debit card for the account she's using for zelle. m will order her one.~~A customer wants the bank to sign IRS forms on his behalf.

I tell her to check the envelopes she has on her table. She finds it. I tell her I just got a new card ordered for her. She is not happy.~~Mrs Customer calls to inquire about the reason her credit limit increase was denied. Me explains that the eligibility is based on Mrs Customer's annual income, her payment history and her credit score. Mrs Customer is not satisfied with the answer and argues that her sister in law, who has the same debts as she does, received her credit limit increase. Me apologizes if she came off as rude, but stands by her answer. Mrs Customer hangs up.~~At least once a day I get a call from someone who is upset about their credit card statement. Right up front I will admit I'm not a math genius but I know how to use the basic four functions. The statement is set up with a summary that gives you all the amounts for payments, charges, etc. It's adding or subtracting to figure out your statement balance (also provided for you). I don't know why it's so hard to accept the statement balance, especially when I spend 30 minutes explaining it over and over!!!~~I love my job and the company I work for because we really try to do the best for our customers.

Yesterday, a female called because her grandfather's debit card was cracked. She was screaming at me because she thought I could fix it. I couldn't, but I could transfer her to the team that could help. She was rude throughout the call. Later, a man called.

I took a deep breath, knowing what was coming, and informed him that I would not be able to waive the interest. He then goes on a near-ten minute tirade about the evils of the bank and every other whack-a-doodle conspiracy he could come up with. Again, he was charged less than $2 in interest. *finally* he says the magic words, ""I want to speak to your manager!"", so I was able to escalate it and avoid the hit to my survey scores- or at least that's the way it should have happened. A couple of days later, lo and behold, there's Captain Conspiracy giving me a 1 on a survey because I was a ""jack-booted bank thug who wouldn't waive this minute amount of interest"".

The customer gets belligerent and insults the company representative.~~20 years ago, I worked in a call center for a large online retailer. We sold many things, but notable for this tale, all kinds of women's clothes. One evening, we get a guy who calls and hangs up on even man who answers. When he gets a woman, he proceeds to ask for help shopping, claiming that hes buying some things for his sister. Calls quickly get weird as the guy asks the women how the clothing would look on them, along with asking about the details of our phone agents' body type, hair color, etc. Our phone agent ends the call, and reports the incident. It's a slow night, but it takes some time for the info to percolate through the floor. An hour or so later, I've sent the number to phone support to be blocked on the front end, but it was after hours. It wouldn't be blocked on the system until the following morning. I've also told my agents that they can drop the call as soon as his number shows on their phones. The guy keeps calling though.~~Newspaper company worker complains about not being paid enough for dealing with difficult clients who don't respond to emails in a timely fashion.

We were both on a call at the same time. I could hear him opening a drawer in the kitchen. The customer on the other end asked to speak to my supervisor because she could hear him in the background. I put her on hold and complained to my boyfriend. I then called my escalations line. My escalations boss answered and I explained the situation. She made a note on the account stating that since we can't guarantee who the customer speaks to, she asked the customer to call back until she reaches someone else.~~Not sure if I'm posting this in the right place, but I figure some of you will enjoy it. I used to work for an outdoor leisure equipment distributor. One of the backpack brands we sold had a very solid lifetime warranty on everything. Only exceptions were purposeful dammage and bags too dirty/stinky for inspection. Client calls in and tells me he fell into a stream while biking, and his bag now stinks as the water was contaminated. I explain to him our policy but add that it can easily be washed at home and recommend a few products that he can safely use in a bath/sink while wearing gloves. Client retorts that it would be unsanitary to use his bath. I don't want to argue that point so I suggest a bucket or wash basin. Customer proceeds to lose his patience and goes on a rant about how he doesn't have a wash basin and he's on facebook groups with over 40,000 bikers who are all his friend, and that he'll tell tell them all about the poor service we've given him.~~A customer calls to return a fridge he just received as it does not fit in his space. After some back and forth, it becomes clear that the customer ordered the wrong size fridge and that the company did not make a mistake in the advertisement.

As the manager is not in, the customer will have to call back the next day.~~Mrs Somebody was waiting for an engineer to come and fix her TV aerial. She was not happy when she called the company to ask where the engineer was.

2.0,"When I was in my early 20s I used to middle-manage a fast food chain store. I was sitting in the back office doing some paperwork when I got a call on the store phone. For context, the only people who call a fast food store are either other stores asking to borrow product, or angry customers with a wrong order. Here's how the conversation went.

m=me c=customer 

m: #4343 how can I help you?

c: Hi yes, I went to your store 2 days ago before leaving on a trip to [other side of the country] state and ordered 2 tacos with cheese and extra sauce.

m: Okay.

c: Well, when I got to x state and unpacked my stuff the next day, and my tacos are soggy.

m:..............I'm sorry, what?

c: No!~~Essential or non-essential? That's the question. And it's a question that many customers are failing to understand, according to this Mids-to-luxury range non-essential products customer service drone.

The person who took the order after her helped her change the order and had the order delivered.~~I work in customer service for a fitness equipment company. We sell directly from the manufacturer, so we can offer better prices than Amazon. We're also sold out on Amazon, and price is higher in stores vs direct through us manufacturer. I'm working from home taking calls and emails. We have 2 out of 3 warehouses open for our big fitness equipment company. 3rd phone call this morning: Bitchlady wants to know what's going on with her order. She placed it Saturday. I explain to her that her order hasn't shipped yet but will likely by tomorrow. From there it can take 10-15 days to get to her, but typically most customers are getting a call for delivery signature appointment to be made by the second week. Bitchlady gets more and more upset with me and my explanations, and she eventually hangs up on me.~~My colleague got this one a couple of months back when we were working close on a Friday night. It's 6.30pm, we close at 7. Customer calls up looking for his order, irate because it was due several hours ago. We get the necessary info and call the delivery driver. He's been stick in traffic for hours due to a massive accident on a major freeway, big enough it's made the news.

We fielded all sorts of inquiries, from damaged order complaints to product questions to intense discussions about the causes we supported. There was one customer who would call up every so often and say she was interested in placing an order. I'd ask her what she would like, and she'd say, ""I'm not sure, tell me what you have!"" It would turn into a long conversation, sometimes as much as three quarters of an hour, during which we'd discuss her hair and her skin and what her favourite smells were and what she liked to do to pamper herself. She'd inevitably end up spending several hundred dollars on a variety of products, none of which she had decided on in advance of calling. I often wondered why she preferred having everything pitched to her like that rather than browsing our online catalogue at her own pace before calling to place her order, but it sure beat getting yelled at by Susan from Louisiana who ordered bath melts in July with ground shipping and thought they'd arrive in solid form, so I never complained.~~Me: Hi there, how can I help you? Customer: I would like to file a complaint. Me: Oh, okay. What is the nature of the complaint? Customer: The solution in my contacts contains Thimersol and Mercury, which are very harmful to us.

I had to take a five minute break to cry - and that never happens. But this afternoon I had someone call who was close to reward and trying really hard not to get angry. She needed a replacement part for a bed. The part that had been sent was the wrong one. Normal protocol is ask for photos, resend the right part. Not with her. She was acting so impatient, so annoying that I was getting close to just saying that I can't break protocol, deal with it, when she burst into tears.~~I work in a call center. I took a customer call today regarding applying patina to his zinc sheet. he said there were chunks and a weird filmy layer, but no patina forming. I asked him if he mixed 25 parts water to 1 part concentrate (zinc is super reactive). he said no he mixed the flakes with the solution and then poured it on. In turn I asked him, what flakes? as its a liquid solution. he said the flakes that were in the bag with it. I had to stop myself from doing a face palm while on the phone. The flakes he was referring to was a super absorbent packing material in case the bottle leaked. It was a cork material. This was the cause of his issue. I informed he he would need to remove the packing material from the concentrate, shake it up quite well to get it to work again and then add water and apply multiple layers. Not ten minutes after ending the call he called again. He thought I said 5 parts water to 1 part concentrate and asked about straining mediums.","Not a call center , but customer called my store.~~""The world was closed, ma'am.""~~I’ve devolved into a child, and resorted to just repeating myself.~~When a ""I wants to speak to your manager"" call goes right.~~""so with everything going on you CAN'T EXPEDITE MY ORDER!!?""~~Cancel my order!~~Don't even think about putting your headset down!~~Read you the whole catalogue?

Alrighty, that's easy enough to fix, I'll just speak to our delivery team and get this sorted for you quick as a button. *I called our delivery team* So customer didn't get the right car seat, she got that one, not this one. According to them, the system says her car seat hasn't shipped yet so now we spend 25 minutes trying to figure out how she somehow got an extra car seat on in her delivery.~~Cx's package didn't arrive today.

It is very unfair to leave a negative review for a problem that the company cannot solve without being told about it.~~This guy calls me (customer support) about a problem with a coupon he got from a warehouse auction. He bought some of our product from a warehouse auction. We don't sell our product to the public, we only use approved vendors and businesses to sell our stuff. So right off the bat, this sounds sketchy as hell. He bought the product and this warehouse gave him a coupon to use online. He put in the coupon info and his computer shut down. He called the warehouse the next day and they said that we would honor the coupon if he called us and explained the situation. I explain to him that we don't have coupons, nor do we participate in warehouse auctions, so there's nothing I can do for him. I offer to transfer him to our customer service dept, where he may have better luck for a resolution. He refuses, saying that he wouldn't speak with any indians, because they don't know what america is. I tell him again that there's literally nothing I can do for him, but he won't speak with anyone else. I put him through to our cs anyway (they're all us citizens, by the way). My mistake.~~Karen is angry because she had to wait too long to place an order on New Year's Eve. She asks to speak to a customer service agent. Superfleh, who is actually the escalated transfer supervisor, helps her. Karen is not satisfied and asks to speak to the manager. Superfleh is the manager too.~~This happened last night. I work for a company that sells overpriced boxes and organization items. Most of our customers are upper middle class trophy wives and angry New Yorkers so it's fun. Our store offers a pickup option where the customer can purchase items online and pick them up in the store or at a designated spot in the parking lot. (this is important) I'll be ""me"" and she'll be ""lw"" (lazy woman) Me - ""thank you for calling ___ this is ___, how can i help you today?"" Lw - ""i'm here to pick up my items"" She already sounds pretty grouchy Lw - ""um!?? dc! i'm here for my pickup!!"" At this point she's almost screaming Me - ""i see, right now their phone systems are down so i don't have a way for contact them. You'll have to go into the store to pick up your order"" Lw - ""i'm in the store"" Me - ""you're in the store, not the-"" Lw - (cutting me off) ""yes, im standing at the pickup counter. where else would i be??~~A woman called ### to place an order for her mother. ### needed to speak to the card holder to proceed with the order.

Mr. A needs to know when his shipment will be delivered. Timeladywinchester tells him it will be delivered tomorrow before 1pm. Mr. A is not happy with this as he thinks the company should work 7 days a week.~~A guy called our customer service line very angry. He said he received a letter from our company addressed to him. His wife saw it and thought he was seeing another woman. She kicked him out and he is calling us from a bus station. I apologized for the confusion. He was not interested in an apology. He wanted to speak to our management. I tried to wave down a floor manager but they were all busy. I went into a scripted response. I will pass his information to our marketing team so they know not to send him any more promotional mail. He said he is going to get a lawyer and he is going to sue our ass. He hung up after that.~~Mr. C's order was being held at the shipping company's distribution center. M called Mr. C and told him to wait a few more days for the order to be delivered.

Yesterday was Thanksgiving here in the states, so work was busy. Most calls were about lifespan of food, how to cook something, can you defrost a 22 pound turkey in 24 hours. Normal stuff. Then random lady calls in. She bought some yogurt that was accidentally frozen at the store. She kept laughing about how absurd it was. Then she told me that the container somehow fell/hit her causing her to have a black eye. Rl then says that she goes to the hospital a lot and they asked her if she was being abused. She tells them no and that her black eye was from yogurt.~~ida wants to return some plastic fixtures. She ordered some samples, but she doesn't want to keep all of them. Ida is convinced she didn't order samples, but an actual product. She is very stubborn and doesn't want to believe me or my coworker. She ended up getting another order of samples because she wants to see the metal fixtures.~~Hi y'all, at the time of these calls, I worked for a food-delivery service. You'd get a box with recipes and matching ingredients on a weekly basis. I quickly learned that a lot of our customer-base adhered to a ""traditional"" approach when it came to cooking.   My colleague and I where doing outbound calls to regular and long time customers who had paused for an unusual amount of time.~~c ordered an orange dress a week ago. She hasn't received the order yet. Me is trying to locate the order. c doesn't have the order number. Me can't see any orders for an orange dress in the last few weeks. c made two attempts to place the order. Neither of them went through. Me needs the order number to be able to assist further. c hangs up.~~So I work for retail. We sell jewelry (not expensive). I got a call from a customer who was angry about the status of his order.

Someones faucet starts leaking, they call, I mail them parts to fix it. Its pretty easy and a lot of the calls are standard. 

but theres a girl at work who gets the weirdest calls. every day some complete loon calls her. one time a dude emailed in a picture of his faucet so she could identify what model it was, and in the reflection off the faucet you could see the guys wife standing naked behind him! 

but my absolute favorite was a couple of weeks ago where this lady calls in with a faucet that isnt flowing very well. she turns on the cold water and nothing comes out. so my coworker is walking her through the steps to take the handle off and check to see if the valve is clogged. well, turns out its clogged, so my coworker was getting ready to explain to her how to flush the faucet out...but before she could, this customer up and went and grabbed a god damn straw and starting sucking the water out of the faucet! immediately this woman starts gagging and vomiting all over her floor.~~So I work in customer experience for an e-commerce company and I don't know what the hell is going on at this US Postal Service facility specifically, but my god. 90% of the time I have someone in my inbox about a lost package, it was last seen on the way to this black hole.

Customer: My delivery was pushed back again. It's national news that the global supply chains are messed up but no one assumes that applies to their order. She then demands we switch her delivery to include assembly for free. Her reasoning is that she ordered this expecting her neighbor to assist her but he is moving so we should do it for free. I told her that I can ask the delivery if they would add it but they probably won't do it for free. Needless to say, so asked for a supervisor.~~I work in customer service. Part of my job is to price match competitors. There is a maximum amount we are allowed to discount, and it's pretty high. For example, we might price match a $1000 item to $900.

Our website was updated to include this delay, but a lot of customers seem to just skip over it. So when they call, they're upset (which I completely understand) But what makes it worse is that we are unable to transfer customers to other agents/representatives, managers, etc. If they want to speak to a manager, we have to email a call back request.

The customer did not want his wife to find out about the new driver. I suggested he cancel the amendment. He eventually accepted the changes.~~For clarity, I am in the UK. Our policy was always you must inform us if you plan to take the car overseas. This is due to the insurance we place and also just so we know where the cars are in case of an issue. So one day I answer the phone and get crazy guy (cg). He rented from one of our London branches the day before. He's had an accident. crashed he car straight into a toll booth.~~A couple of years ago I worked for a claims center that dealt with auto glass claims. As part of our training we would do role play claims. This was when 2 people would pair up and one would be the policy holder and the other would be the agent. We would, as the ""policy holder"", actually call the phone in front of the other person and they would then begin the claim process. So we were told to be creative on our claims...and I was.~~A call centre worker has shared some of the ridiculous things customers have said to him. The anonymous employee works in the UK for a large life insurance company. His job involves helping customers understand their policies. Some of the questions he fields are frankly bizarre and he has now decided to share some of the best ones with the internet. They are all real questions that he has received.~~Caller is upset because her premium has gone up. Me looks for the reason and finds out that Caller had a collision. Caller didn't consider it a collision, because she didn't hit another car, but a trailer. Me explains that it's still a collision and shows Caller the amounts of damage. Caller is not happy and claims that those accidents happened with different cars and different insurance companies. Me explains that it doesn't matter, because it shows a trend of being at fault for accidents. Caller is not convinced and claims that she's going to report it to the state.~~A woman called her auto insurance company to complain that she was not seeing the discount she was promised for removing her mother from her policy. The customer service representative fixed the problem and gave the woman the discount. However, the woman was not happy that the discount was backdated. The insurance company would not have backdated the discount if the woman had kept quiet.~~Caller is screaming at his girlfriend because she didn't pay for his motorcycle insurance on time. His last chance to make a payment is tomorrow, otherwise, the policy will be cancelled at 12:01 am on Friday. Me (an insurance agent) can't help him because he already got an extension - the cancellation notice. I put him on hold and call my supervisor. My supervisor also can't help him and suggests that he makes the payment today. The man hangs up and later makes the payment online.~~So I work in retention for a company that sells mobile phone insurance products for a long list of clients. Most of our policies are a rip-off and not worth having. Customer calls with a phone that is notorious for being easily damaged, expensive to repair and replace. He also has a very old policy that is actually a fraction of the cost of what he should have and the excess fee is literally 90% lower than what it would be if he had the correct policy. He is adamant he wants to cancel the policy as he will get it cheaper with a competitor. (We administer the insurance for most of the competitors and he absolutely cannot get.better deal elsewhere, but I'm not allowed to tell him I know this.) I tried everything and he absolutely wasn't having it to the point he was being rude, swearing and being abusive. Accusing me of trying to rip him off. I laid it out one last time, explained how much cheaper his policy was than what we'd be able to offer him in the future. His reply?~~I work in car insurance. A customer wanted me to quote his car. I couldn't because of the car's value and the young drivers. He kept asking me to quote it. I explained it in multiple ways. This conversation actually took around ten minutes before he understood.~~Yesterday, we had a lady call in looking to get new copies of her contract and policy certificate mailed to her as she had misplaced hers. She gave her name and date of birth, as she did not have her policy number. Our phone rep tried to look her up and did not find anything, but she was adamant that she was calling the right place and had a policy with us. I was currently in this phone rep's office on another matter when the call came in, so I took over the phone call and kept her on speaker as a bit of training for my coworker to learn how to problem solve these situations, as they happen all the time.~~I work in an insurance call center. A customer called yesterday to replace a car on their policy with a new one. The old car was a 2015 BMW. The new car was a 2018 Camry. I quoted the price and then explained the difference in their monthly total. The customer interrupted me with the little exchange in the title.~~While working in an insurance company, I listened in on some claims calls. One of the first ones we took went a little like this: Customer: Hi, I need to report my phone as damaged. My son dropped it on the way to school this morning and the screen is unusable. Claims handler: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me bring up your policy and we can get this sorted. However, the policy number isn't bringing up anything. Claims handler: Let me place you on hold and I'll call through to the servicing side and get them to confirm the policy cover. Servicing handler: Hello, servicing my name is sh. Claims handler: Hi can you confirm the cover for this policy number? Sh: Hmm they have contents only cover with accidental damage included. Claims handler: Is the policy paid to date? Sh: They haven't had a chance to it was only taken out at 10am. Claims handler: What? Okay, let me go back to the customer and ask them some questions.~~A guy has 3 payments come back insufficient in the last 6 months. He's calling because his recent payment won't go through. This is the 4th return payment. The insurance company isn't offering reinstatement. The guy was ranting. The call lasted 30 minutes, it should have been 5.~~Caller wants information on her cousins policy. I need her cousins consent to release the information. Auto insurance company doesn't apply to hipaa. Caller will be looking around for other insurance.~~I work in an insurance call center handling complex technical calls, escalations, and some cursory underwriting calls. most of what I get are ho-hum technical calls from reps requesting my sage advice about how to handle a quote/policy question. I also handle escalations about billing and underwriting, which are usually a variation of ""how dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free!"" Because I work a swing shift that borders on overnights, I deal with more than just your garden variety of crazy or the demanding karen. most of my callers are people with enough dedication to call an insurance company at 2 a.m. to complain about their bills, but not always enough dough and/or dedication to pay said bills.","Don't cheat on your wife~~Insurance fraud ma’am, it’s a real thing.~~How not to commit insurance fraud #5~~Entering wife's policy because you work in corporate and making a complaint about the price - get fired.~~“Don’t interrupt me! ....

3.0,"I work in an insurance company. On Tuesday I got a call from a policyholder asking for something in regards to their insurance claim. At the end of the call the policyholder advised that they would like to know my name. I said that my name was [First name] and asked if they would like to know my surname. They advised that they would like to know my surname is Seabridge. I was shocked. I had never heard anyone say anything like this. She laughed as she was only joking but it made me very uncomfortable. I tried to laugh it off and carried on.~~My job is to handle calls from clients who are confused about the insurance refunds for the months of April and May. Most of the calls are from people who do not understand the requirements for the refund. There is one lady who is particularly rude. She does not understand why she is not getting a refund. I explain to her that her policy was canceled 4 days into April. She hangs up on me.~~A woman called my work's call center. She was paying for plans for several adult children, but legally she isn't the owner since they're over 21. Thus, we can't give her information that doesn't relate to the payment. It's not only our policy, but we've been told it's a legal issue with confidentiality and personal information. We can lose our jobs if we break the rule. She was also upset we hadn't notified her of changes enough, but we'd been sending reminders multiple times a year since 2016. She even admitted at the beginning of the call that she rarely opens mail from us. It was still our fault though, apparently.~~I work in an insurance call center. I'm considered an underwriter and I only talk to agents. Everyone contacting us should be licensed, or work for a licensed agent. Meaning... somewhat educated. I recently moved over to chat instead of phones and it's an entirely different kind of stupid.~~A very impatient customer called her insurance company. She wanted them to wait so she could put on her pajamas. The fact that she told them it would be a while meant they should have waited longer. She called them back and tried to make them wait so she could get in her pajamas so she could be comfortable during the call.~~My job is mostly just handling ho-hum technical calls. Most of the calls I take are about billing and underwriting, which are usually a variation of ""how dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free."" The call I'm about to describe is probably one of the most memorable deviations from the norm I've ever had. 

Picture it: my junk room-turned-office space in these times of covid with your intrepid writer waiting for a call. In one hand is my third can of diet coke for the night. In the other hand is a copy of a Stephen King novel. Not just any Stephen King novel, but Dreamcatcher. The headset beeps and the call comes through from one of the new reps on the phone in sales.~~A thread on Reddit has revealed the ridiculous things customers have demanded of call centre staff. One user described how a man became irate when he was told he couldn't change the terms of his car insurance policy. The customer had called the call centre to complain that his son's policy judged his driving every 90 days, and he didn't want the dangerous times (between 11pm and 5am) to affect his son's driving score. When the user explained that the terms and conditions clearly stated that they could not change the policy, the man demanded that they escalate the complaint to the highest person possible. He also said he would contact his solicitor and his MP.~~I work in auto/motorcycle insurance. A customer's motorcycle policy is pending cancellation because the auto payment system was unable to pull the monthly payment. The customer is refusing to make the payment and is offended that we would even consider cancelling her insurance for one missed payment. I find it extremely hilarious but I also wonder what she expects would happen if a payment didn't go through.~~I work in an insurance call center. A client calls in for car insurance on their vehicle. The annual rate for this vehicle was $1670. The month before they only ended up paying $100 for 1 month as they transferred from the old car to the new car with 1 month left in the term and $100 was the difference. They called for the renewal and I quoted $1670 for the year which is $147 a month. He said no, he was told it was $100 a month. I said that that was just because he transferred from the old car and this is a new term with the new car. He agreed that it was $1670 for the year but insisted that the other insurance broker told him that he could get it for $100 a month.~~A man left his house for the weekend, holding a big party. He locked the door behind him. When he returned, the house had been completely destroyed. Everything was broken, stained and needed to be replaced. He put in a claim to his insurance company. The claim was denied as the man had failed to show reasonable judgement.~~A guy called me at my previous job at an insurance company. He was very rude from the very beginning. He was screaming and insulting me. He did not want to give me his information so I could transfer him to my manager. He kept insisting on talking to my manager. I explained to him that without validating his information I could not transfer him. He did not want to listen to me. He was really mad. I gave him two warnings and after his third warning, I disconnected the call.~~customer: my mother just passed away, and i found policy papers with her things. me: i am so sorry to hear that. how can i assist you today? customer: it says here that i'm the beneficiary of this policy. i'd like to know how to claim the money. me: absolutely! what's the insured's name and policy number, as well as your name?

Me explains that the premium can increase or decrease depending on the address. Al works in car insurance and has never heard of such thing. Al is going to report Me's company to the department of insurance.~~insurance fraud is a huge problem in the US.  one of the most common forms of fraud is rated location fraud, or rate jumping. this is when a customer misrepresents where their vehicle is located for the purpose of paying lower insurance rates. in some of the more blatant cases, people say they live somewhere like upstate ny, but they really live in brooklyn (an area with very high insurance rates- much higher than upstate- and anyone who's driven there knows it's warranted).~~A man wanted to cancel an insurance policy. He felt that it was an inconvenience. He was perfectly capable. He just felt he should not have to. He argued with the lady on the phone for a good few minutes about it.~~A woman who works in an insurance call centre has shared the ridiculous questions some of her customers have asked. The anonymous writer, who works in the US, said one of her favourite calls was from a man who wanted to know if insurance followed the vehicle or the driver. She explained that in some cases it followed both but, in the example he gave, it would only follow the driver because his wife was not listed on the policy. The man then asked if he needed to exclude every person on earth from driving his car, to which she replied: ""Sir, as long as you're not allowing every person on earth to drive your Toyota Tercel, you should be fine.~~I work in a call center. My job is to take payments for a pet insurance company. Today I had one lady call in and state she wanted to cancel pet insurance she agreed to for 1 year and when she called the insurance provider they required her to pay for the full year per the agreement she signed with them because she doesn't want to use them and claims she can't afford her payments. So she called me, the credit card agent, now I like my job but hate people like this, she wanted us to cancel it by removing her card from them and for 20 minutes I kept having to tell her we cannot cancel we are only a form of payment. She kept trying to make it sound like we have to do it but nope, we are only a form of payment. Seriously, if you can't afford something don't sign an agreement with them.~~Graded calls are a very touchy subject among call center employees. Depending on the company, a graded call can mean a lot of things. It can be a great tool to help employees improve and grow or it can be used to fire someone. It all depends on the company and how the management chooses to use it.~~A woman called her insurance company to change her coverage. During the call, her dog barked. The insurance agent asked what breed the dog was, and the woman replied that it was a pit bull. The dog used to be aggressive, but the woman had trained it. The agent then explained that the woman's policy had to be cancelled because of the breed.~~Karen phoned her health insurance company's call centre. She needed to know her guarantees to order new glasses. Op couldn't find them in the database and had to transfer her to her manager. Karen was furious and kept saying she needed the information now to avoid a 3-month wait. The manager took the call. Karen kept ranting about the 3-month wait and suggested they work 24/7. The manager promised to look for the guarantees immediately after the call, contacted her supervisor and hung up. Karen received the information she needed later that day.~~I used to work in an insurance call centre. A woman called to make a claim for some broken hairdressing scissors. It turned out she only took out the policy yesterday afternoon, after the damage had already happened. She didn't understand and got angry. She called back 10 minutes later and tried to have the exact same conversation with me, not realising I was the same person.~~I work in an insurance office. We sell insurance. We had a client set up on a 4 payment plan and he missed his payment. After about a week or so late, he cancelled the policy as the car sold. He asked about the refund and was told it was a very small amount. When you are on the 4 payment plan, the first payment is larger so that if you miss a payment, you have time to make the next one late without being cancelled right away. He asked why his refund was not hundreds of dollars, as the payment that was recently due was over $200.

3.0,"I'm an insurance agent. During my call center career I was second-tier customer support for an insurance company. We had three different locations across three different states, and certain policies were only handled by one location.

The unnamed worker posted the story on Reddit, and it has since been upvoted nearly 10,000 times. See also: The best one-liners from the new Ricky Gervais comedy, Derek.

Her previous policy got canceled due to non payment, and she really needed to get a new policy written. I go through the quote with her, give her the rate plus the past due amount from her old policy. It's not pretty, but she knows she has to pay it.~~Me: I can backdate the cancellation or coverage to June 2nd, but that will mean a valid lapse of coverage from June 2nd to the day you turned in the plates, which will result in fines and penalties from the DMV in your state and may result in license suspension. Policyholder: No. Me: Im sorry sir? Policyholder: No. I don't accept those terms. Me: Of course sir. So to avoid those issues lets take coverage off, effective for the date you actually turned in the plates, July 30th. Policyholder: Okay and then what will my July refund be? Me: Since we would be looking at providing insurance coverages and service for all of July, there would be no July refund. Policyholder: No. There will be because I didn't have the car for July.

A user claiming to be a customer service representative for an insurance company posted that they love it when customers threaten to cancel their policy as it means he can say ""go ahead"". The reason? The policy holder has used his car for ridesharing, which the insurance company has decided to temporarily stop covering. The thread attracted dozens of comments, many from traditional taxi drivers, who have been hit hard by the rise of ride-hailing apps. One such commenter claimed that after switching to become an Uber driver, he was let go by his taxi company because his car was too old.~~Customer service.  we all hate it, right?  i work for a large insurance company, providing customer service to an array of customers.  i was speaking with a client last week who was absolutely coming apart at the seams over a clause to his policy.  a clause that neither he nor i can change.  he said at first that he would contact his employer, and i told him he could do that if he chose to (it's their damn policy, anyway!).  he then said, ""i guess i'll just have to contact a lawyer.  is that what you want me to do!?  is that what i'm going to have to do!~~Mary Sue is calling to make a payment on John Doe's insurance policy.

But this one call yesterday was interesting to say the least. So they called in and was very upset about their dental visit claim being denied. They were yelling saying that we embarrassed her because when she went to the dentist office she was told we never paid them from her last visit. She was going on and on about how we are incompetent and made her look bad and how this is unprofessional and should've been taken care of. So I check the claim and see the denial reason and check her benefits and what do you know? She doesn't have dental with us. So patiently I let her get all she needed off her chest and apologized for any inconvenience and inform her that she didn't have dental coverage with us. She said ""Then who is my dental with?""

I wasnt even past the first page trying to get a clear idea of what was happening (dude just kept repeating information that was not what I needed, and wasnt contributing to the call) before he went full entitled twit. He was yelling at me that he was going to sue the company if we tried to make him pay for a collision.

He was arguing that the part wouldn't have been damaged, so it must be a weak part (its a bash plate under your car- what are you expecting? adamantium?) but he needed it fixed today and was going to tell the shop to fix the part, but he would not pay anything.~~A story from the world of customer service. Names have been changed to protect the guilty.

It was a cold dark night. The kind of night that makes you want to stay in and watch a movie. Alas, I was at work.

I answered the phone and immediately recognised the voice on the other end. This person had called several times before, always with some complaint or another. Most of the time it was something petty and I was able to resolve the issue quickly. Not this time.

He was cancelling his pet insurance policy. His pet had sadly passed away and he was due a payout. I processed the cancellation and explained that as he had made a claim he was not entitled to a pro rata refund. He did not like this answer. At all. He got angry. Really angry. He said I was breaking the law and tried to scam him. I remained calm and professional (I hope) and told him he could make an official complaint if he wished. He declined and said he had already done that. The call ended.

I checked his file after to see the complaint and saw that it was for something completely unrelated. I couldn't believe it.~~I'm an insurance claims adjuster. Every. Single. Day. I hear people yelling at me because their deductible is too high and they want me to change it. Or they want me to waive it. Or they want me to change it back. Or they want me to do something that I literally cannot do, like go back in time and undo something that has already been done. It's incredibly frustrating. I'm just the person who helps people file claims. I'm not policy services. I'm not an agent. I can't just change your deductible on a whim just because you're angry and frustrated. No, I cannot waive it. No, I cannot change it. No, you cannot call policy services and change your deductible and then call back to file the claim, if you already started a claim. If you have given me a date of loss, thats in the computer forever, your new deductible starts after midnight. The insurance company always wins. I'm not disputing that. But don't yell at me. I am not responsible for your insurance policy coverage choices.~~Him: Hello. I drive for Uber and they need a copy of my updated insurance documents. I don't know why you guys haven't sent me the new ones yet! Me: You drive for Uber? Him: Yes! Send me the policy documents over to my email. I need them now! Me: Sure, I can definitely send that over. If your car is used for rideshare we do require higher liability limits. So in updating that you use the car for Uber we will have to update your coverages. Him: Yes, sure, go ahead and do that. Me: Ok, in updating your vehicle use and giving you the required coverage that is going to increase your monthly rate by $42. Him: $42 a month? I'm not paying an extra $42 a month! Me: That is the required coverage for all vehicles used for ride sharing. And since you informed us that you drive for Uber, we do have to update that information. Him: I don't drive for Uber. I used to drive for Uber, back in like 2019. Longggg time ago. I stopped due to the pandemic. You know, covid really changes everything.~~I work in insurance. A customer called wanting to reinstate a policy that has been canceled for a year. This is not allowed. The customer works in insurance herself and knows that. I am not paid on commission. After a year, we cannot reinstate the policy. I need the vehicle information to do the quote. The customer is antagonizing me. She is rude and unprofessional.~~Jake from State Farm shares two cringy moments from his work as an insurance agent. The first call is from a customer who wants to make sure he's covered in the event he's hit by an uninsured driver. Jake explains the different coverages and the customer eventually reveals his hatred for Mexicans. The second call is from a woman who is having trouble understanding something on her bill. Jake offers to call her lender with her to straighten out the issue. The lender picks up and the woman immediately asks where the lender is from. Jake jumps in and asks for the info change so he can get off the phone.~~Caller wants to claim for storm damage to roof. Employee checks weather database and denies the claim because the weather was not severe enough to cause damage. Caller lives on exposed hillside and claims that the weather is always worse than reported. Employee reveals that the houses in the street were used as training examples for houses in poor states of repair.~~I worked for an insurance company. This lady called in to cancel her insurance on her ex-boyfriends car, because he didn't live there anymore. But it turned out he had also racked up a 300 mobile bill in her name, by adding his new girlfriends teenage kid to the contract. He also went shopping with her and the kid, from a joint bank account he had never contributed too. And he had a habit of speeding.~~I work at an insurance company. One time, I got a call from a woman who wanted to close her policy and get her death benefit. The policy was worth $250,000+. I explained to her that the death benefit can only be paid after the insured person dies. She did not believe me and threatened to sue the company. I transferred her to one of our case managers.~~Auto/motorcycle insurance. Older gentleman calls inquiring on a refund he got. I explained to him that since he was paid out a bit further than the date he cancelled his policy it resulted in a refund! Yay. Caller: Why isn't my refund more? Me: Sir, I apologize but since the policy was cancelled early there was a cancellation penalty applied so the refund amount is correct. Caller: Thats not legal to do!! Me: Yes it is. Sir, it is stated in the contract you signed that there is a penalty for early cancellation. Caller: Well im sending the bureau and my lawyer after you! This is not legal!!! Click.~~A woman called the insurance company where a friend of hers works. She wanted to make a claim. However, the woman had the wrong company. The insurance company couldn't help her and told her to call the company she had insurance with. The woman was outraged.~~Today I spoke with a patient that was upset that we had billed him for 10% of his balance instead of 20% because his insurance told him that once he meets his deductible that they will pay claims at 80/20, but we are billing him at 90/10. He insisted that his insurance needs to reprocess his claims and that he will not pay his bill until this is corrected because he doesn't want to pay too much. Ummm…math is hard. The cherry on top: while I was looking into his insurance he started violently coughing and gagging. When I inquired about his welfare he said that he was spraying weed killer and that the wind had shifted and now it was spraying in his face!~~I was working at the customer service of an insurance company, and often had to open insurance claims. One day a customer calls me, he wanted to open a disability claim because he had 2 fingers amputated after an accident (index and middle finger). So I start asking the usual questions to open the claim file. Once I got all the information I needed, I told the customer: ""The claim is ready to go, you will receive forms within 10 business days. Do you have any questions?"" The customer then asks me: ""Do you think I'll be accepted?"" I replied: ""Well, I cannot confirm if it will be or not, but since it's an accident my guess it that it should be fine. I'll cross my fingers for you..."" The customer burst into laughter and the call ended well.~~Customer wants to make a claim. Meant to call the auto claims department but called the home owners claims department by mistake. According to the system, there are two active home owners policies under the customer's information. The customer is confused and annoyed.~~A dental patient became enraged after her insurance claim was rejected. The patient had called the day before to confirm she could claim for a crown. When she called back the next day to claim, the system rejected her claim. The patient began to yell and demand that the insurance company pay her. The insurance company employee explained that the patient had claimed for the wrong procedure. The patient did not know that she needed to get a scan of her teeth before getting a crown. The employee would launch a complaint on the patient's behalf.~~$me = me $am = angry member $me: Thank you for calling [company], my name is noddy. Can I get your first and last name please? $am: Sure, give me a moment. $me: What is your policy number? $am: *reads off policy number* $me: Okay, I'm going to place you on a brief hold while I access your policy. $am: Okay. $me: Thank you for holding. Yes, we can insure a vehicle with a salvaged title, however, the salvaged title will be taken into account when determining the actual cash value of your vehicle in the event of a total loss. However, we will still charge you the full premium. $am: Um, can you explain that in English, please? $me: I apologize, sir. What that means is that because the title is salvaged, the car is likely worth less than one with a clean title. So, even if the vehicle is in the same current condition as one with a clean title, the actual cash value would be diminished and would be considered by an adjuster if you were to have a total loss.","Screw yourself over and don’t listen to me, because I’m telling you no for the fun of it apparently.~~Customer threatens to complain to FOS for not being entitled to a refund after receiving a payout for his claim~~Don’t scream at me because your deductible is what it is.

3.0,"I work for an auto insurance company and we are not allowed to give out information about other peoples policies to people not listed with specified permission (unless dealer, lien holder, etc, cop). here is a convo I had yesterday. Caller: Thank you for calling XYZ this is me. Am I speaking with policy holder? Me: No this is her mother. She asked me to check on her policy. I want to know if she has the right coverage. Me: Ok great. Can I get your name and date of birth so I can verify you please? Caller: My name is abc def and why do you need my date of birth? Thats none of your business. Youd only need that if you wanted to steal my identity! Anyways I set up this policy for policy holder and she wanted to make sure I got the right coverages for her car. Me: Ok thank you for helping her with the insurance but since youre not listed on the policy, I cant give out that information to you. I have to protect her privacy. Caller: Wha? Thats stupid. I started this policy for her. Are you sure my name isnt there?~~I work as an auto insurance claims rep for a large insurance company that is about as nice as insurance companies get. we of course still get our angry callers. our insured called in because she received a demand from the other vehicle's insurance. she filed a claim with me and as we were getting the details, she explained that the police officer who took the report was racists because they took the other party's statement first and because they did not speak spanish. i'm near the southern border; it happens. i advise i'll take it into consideration. it's a lane change loss, so almost always disputed, so we take a recorded statement. she accepts my offer of a spanish interpreter, and we get into the statement.~~I work for a call center as an insurance agent. I work in general policy servicing and billing. Tonight, a gentleman called in to discuss an extension on his payments. This particular gentleman was recently in a very bad and life threatening accident and was out of work for a few months and shortly after he returned to work, he was laid off. Unemployment wasn't working with him to help him out and he was in desperate place. Immediately, I try to find any loophole I can. Unfortunately, nothing. All of a sudden, I start thinking about how I hate having to bring folks bad news like this. How it kills me to have to tell people in need that there's nothing I can do all because of cooperate policies. It makes me feel like a monster and fear for the day I become one of those agents who can say that sort of thing without any emotion in their voice at all. I immediately break down while the member is on hold. I spend a good 5 minutes or so crying and having an anxiety attack. That's when I realized, I'm not cut out for call center work, as good as the pay is. I'm just too sensitive.~~insurance companies pay us to file their claims for them. they are simply not staffed to do this themselves. and don't get me started on agents who call in asking me ""how do i do this or that?"" i am not an agent. you don't know your job? ok sorry, i am getting off course here. a woman called in yesterday. she has a 2021 bmw fancy car. i begin by expressing sympathy for her glass damage and let her know with a few questions i can help her file her claim and get her set up with a shop to fix the damage.~~i'm an insurance agent with a company that provides a type of insurance required by some employers. we have two different names depending on which category the job falls into, but they're the exact same policies with the exact same staff. half the time i greet people with ""thanks for calling green jobs!"" and half the time it's ""thanks for calling blue jobs!"" same. exact. company. so this woman called in today, and i spent the first five minutes peeling layers off her crazy onion until i actually reached the problem. me: ""thanks for calling blue jobs, this is flyinguineapig, how can i help you today?"" caller: ""i just bought one of your policies, and my documentation has an error."" me: ""i'm sorry to hear about that. i'll take a look at your account and see if we can get that corrected. do you happen to have your policy number?"" so i locate and verify the account, and when i ask her what's wrong with it, she tells me that all the documents we sent her say ""blue jobs"" on them, and she wants them to say ""green jobs."" me: ""oh, i think i can clarify that.~~I worked for a large insurance company via an outsourcer. The outsourcer didn't care about customer service just numbers. I had a lady who lost her partner a few months ago but hadn't got around to removing him from her car insurance. We had to do it at renewal. Normally if changes are made at renewal the policy is recalculated and a new amount is needed. If someone is removed from a policy mid term via death then the policy holder does not pay anymore. The manager spent 30 minutes on the phone telling the woman that nothing would be reduced. The woman was in tears. I felt so bad but I was not giving up on treating the customer right. I sent an email to the client and my operations manager explaining the situation. Needless to say, he was not a manager at the end of that day (but numbers, so he became an agent) and the woman got a massive refund and apology.~~Had a guy call me today asking why he was paying insurance when his claim was back in January and he had received no courtesy car. I explained that the courtesy car is standard on his policy but is subject to availability so if his underwriter have not got one at the time they cant provide a replacement car. He then went on to ask why have I been paying insurance if his claim was back in January. I tried to explain this whole thing again got called an MF. He then warned me that he would terminate the call if I didn't stop trying to help him.~~Me: Thank you for calling insurance co. This is Bee, am I speaking with Msph? Msph: Yeah yeah. I have my 6 month renewal paperwork and you guys are charging way too much. Me: Oh man, let me look into that for you. *sees 3 at fault accidents in the last 6 months resulting in over $10k paid out, a couple surcharges, loss of good driver discounts, and being placed into a high risk pool* Me: Okay, so I am seeing that we were in a couple of minor accidents this last term. When these unfortunate things happen, your insurance does occasionally increase to make sure we have enough money set aside to pay for any past and future damages if they were to happen. Msph: This is ridiculous!!! I have been with your company for years!!! This is how you repay loyal customers? Me: I absolutely understand your frustration, Msph. I can see we definitely protected you from the $xx,xxx amount that was paid out for the accidents so that is really great. But let me look into what further discounts we can offer you! Me: Great! So I am seeing here that you absolutely have the potential for some amazing discounts!~~My job involves selling car insurance. A lot of my customers are foreign and don't know much about the policies. I take time to explain everything to them. Today a customer called me. He had 2 active policies. He wanted to cancel one of them as he had bought a new car and wanted to put both cars on the same policy. After matching up the details on the new policy, I was about to cancel the old one. Then the customer told me that a charity had hired his company to pick up charity donations and drop them off at their depot. He was getting paid for it. I explained to him that this was a hire and reward case. I spent around 40 minutes arguing with him about what hire and reward is.~~Robert Gunn is cancelling his policy. employee: Please could you confirm your name and car registration. caller: Robert Gunn ro 13 gun employee: I can see the policy was rated on your mother, Louise, but we have reason to believe that you are the main driver.

I return her calls as soon as I can, but I'm on multiple lines and one of the busiest CSRs on the floor. If she gets anyone else and I'm unable to take the call, she hangs up on them. She has been offered a remake of the product at no charge, but she refuses. She has been offered a refund, but she refuses. She just wants us to remake the product at no charge and refund all of her money, which means we lose thousands of dollars twice. The thing that threw me over the edge today was that I had a message from a supervisor today saying she filed a complaint because I was not ""taking her seriously"". Really?! The offers were coming from over my head and I had given her all the information I had. I sent multiple emails to our sups letting them know that she would rather talk to them because they were the ones making the offers. Thank god they know the complaint is unfounded and think she's nuts... but I have no idea what this bitch is gonna do next week when I'm out of the office for surgery.~~A claims officer for an insurance company in Australia was evaluating a claim that came in. The claim was from a party that hit another party in the rear. This means the party is required to pay an excess. The officer was looking through the claimer's history and found that he is a terrible driver. The claimer was told that his excess is $2,000. The claimer refused to pay the excess and wanted to cancel his insurance. The officer withdrew the claim, as per the claimer's request.~~I work in an insurance call centre.

I work in an insurance call center handling complex technical calls, escalations, and some cursory underwriting calls. Most of what I get are ho-hum technical calls from reps requesting my sage advice about how to handle a quote/policy question. I also handle escalations about billing and underwriting, which are usually a variation of ""how dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free!"" Because I work a swing shift that borders on overnights, I deal with more than just your garden variety crazy or your average karen.

The anonymous ex-employee of a Canadian insurance company revealed some customers' lack of understanding of how insurance works was astounding.

My job is to investigate claims to find out who is at fault and break the news. I got a multiple car loss and our guy was the middle car of three. I have to find out if he rear ended the car in front and then was rear ended or if he was pushed into the car in front of him by the car behind him. I asked the guy and he says he thinks he stopped in time and then got hit, pushing his car into the car in front of him. But the final nail in the coffin was that the car in front felt 2 impacts: one from him and a second from the force of the car behind. We're negligent. I told the guy and he seemed chill. I let him know his policy and his options and we set up to get his car repaired. Since he has a Tesla, we had someone sent out to his house to do an estimate.

It was still about 4 days out from being looked at. I messaged a friend in the claims department and asked him if he could process the claim for me today.

Unfortunately, Medicaid obtained through disability in our state only pays for a maximum of 12 doctor's appointments per fiscal year. I called her to get some more information about her income and assets to see if she might qualify for another Medicaid category that didn't have appointment limits. After speaking with her for a few minutes I determine that she could potentially qualify for another type of Medicaid without limits; however, it would have required her to give up her disability determination from Social Security as well as her disability income which she didn't want to do.

i go to start the message and realize i'm missing one key piece of information. i don't have a provider name which is needed in order to even start a message. normally not an issue for new patients because if there isn't a particular provider they were told to see (in this case i confirmed there wasn't and she was brand new to that clinic) i can just pick one at random from their provider list. except that that part of their instructions didn't even exist. they told us to send a message but didn't provide all the necessary information to do so.~~Patient calls clinic to confirm her appointment for tomorrow.

This was our conversation.~~I work in a call center. Yesterday I took a call from a lady who thinks her husband's insurance card has been stolen. I verify her and take her call back information. I call the surgery center but they aren't very helpful other than to pull the original file and confirm that they didn't send in a claim for the wrong person. I call the fraud hotline and leave them all the details. Then I call dr. name. It's the psychiatrist. They tell me, ""that's him. He's been a patient here for years."" I outed a guy hiding from his wife.~~I work in a diagnostic imaging center doing phone calls that involve scheduling, medical records, authorizations, and more.

There also happens to be no tech here at all today, and I have no idea why! I decided to make the executive decision to reschedule the earlier appointments.~~I work in a primary care clinic. We have hundreds of appointments every day. Today a lady called in wanting to reinstate her cancelled appointment. I told her it was too late and the appointment was gone.

5.0,"Yesterday I was helping arrange a tow for a lady whose car had a flat tire. Her car was in her apartment's underground parking garage. I explained to her that our underground truck wasn't available until later this afternoon. I offered to send a light service truck to change the tire or she can call back in the afternoon when underground truck is available. She didn't want to call back later. I explained again that light service truck can't tow her car. She didn't want to wait for the underground truck. I offered to send a regular tow truck but she didn't want it.~~i've posted here before, i work at a membership based roadside assistance hotline. some people just... don't seem to understand how these things work. this fine gentleman is one such example of this. this tale begins not with me but my coworker. dude calls in, he's super frustrated because his car isn't starting since he left it in his garage for couple months while he was on vacation and now needs a boost. (car pro tip: if you're going to leave your car sitting for an extended period of time, get a trickle charger for it to prevent battery degradation!) one problem, his membership has a missed payment and needs he needs to settle it before he can get service.~~years ago i worked for a major auto manufacturers customer contact center. this particular manufacturer offered free vehicle modifications for persons with disabilities. it was my first day live on the line by myself after training and i got a customer with a mid level suv that needed the climate control knobs modified due to severe arthritis. the knobs on her particular vehicle were slick shiny black plastic with chrome ring accents, what the part number said they were were cheap grey chunky plastic. she called since the dealer had modified these parts for her, but they didnt match the vehicle or even fit the mounting spindle. she had the original knobs that came with the car, but wanted a couple of backup sets for when these wore out.~~I work at a university for a company that does their parking for them. I am a dispatcher that answers that help button you see on garage machines, and I take customer service calls after hours. The two players are me, and the caller, who shall be referred to as girl. Girl got a parking violation. If a violation is not paid within 24 hours of it being issued, we will get the vehicle owner info from the BMV/DMV and send a letter out with the violation information. Girl doesn't have the money to pay it right now. I don't really care who pays the violation, as long as it is paid. Do you have a friend who could lend you money or pay it for you online? Girl has a friend who will pay it for her.~~Driver calls in to send his updated license. Me gives him an e-mail address to send it to. Driver doesn't have an e-mail address to receive e-mails. He will have to go to the phone store and ask them to set up an e-mail address.~~This story takes place a while ago, but I just recently remembered it. I work at an emergency roadside service hotline. People call us when they're broken down on the roadside. We also provide service to people at their homes, for example, someone needs a tow from their home to a garage, we'll send someone to help them. But those are low priority calls, meaning if someone on the roadside places a request after someone at home does, we prioritize the person on the roadside since they could be in a dangerous situation. As such home calls routinely get their ETAs extended if the area they're in happens to be busy.~~Last night one of our drivers was run over by a member. the member was impatient and jumped in the car while the driver was still loading it up. the driver had his arm under the tire when the member took off. the driver couldn't get out of the way fast enough and the member ran over his arm. the member didn't even stop to see if the driver was okay or to call an ambulance. they just took off. the driver ended up calling us and (understandably) was screaming and crying from the pain. the di that got his call ended up calling an ambulance for him. the supervisor called the owner of the company he worked for (we call them garages) to let them know what happened. the member is talking to the supervisor now and will be filing a police report. i just want to know what was going through the members head because i'm pretty sure that if you didn't feel it when you ran over his arm that you would have figured it out by the drivers screams. their accounts been sent to our critical incident team for review and i told my supervisor that if they don't lose their membership after this, that i will lose all faith in the company going forward.~~Essential businesses are still open during the coronavirus outbreak. However, some customers are unaware that some businesses are only offering call center services. This is the case with a popular roadside assistance company. The company is offering call center services, but customers are unaware and keep calling asking if they can come to the branch.~~A member of roadside assistance company calls to sign up for the company's credit monitoring services. He does not have an e-mail address, so the company's representative tells him he needs one to receive credit alerts. The member refuses to set up an e-mail address and wants to receive the alerts by mail. The representative explains that credit monitoring is an online service, and the member is going to visit his local branch to solve the problem.~~A lady calls me because she forgot her bag in the rental car. She returned the keys to the inbox since the station was closed. I transfer her to assistance. She doesn't want to wait so she will break the window to get her things.~~Yesterday I got a call from a lady complaining about having to walk two blocks in order to get in her car, she was upset because the driver cancelled the ride and was not in the same place she was. After that she requested another ride and got charged a no-show fee. Lady claims she never saw the driver before this driver claimed the no-show fee. In the background her mom and her husband were talking and complaining saying things like ""ohh, you need to get this guys fired, they are really bad drivers, this is why we prefer other companies"". I didn't have to give anything to this lady, and yet I requested permission from my coach to give her a five-dollar coupon. I gave her the coupon. Here is when the call got funny. Lady: ""That's all? No more credit, I need at least 40 dollars in credit for the inconveniences"".~~I work with truck drivers on a daily basis and they're known for their attitudes.

I spoke with you just a moment ago and I assure you I am a man.~~I work in the wonderful world of insurance sales, where the customers are all understanding, kind, sensible, and have always have reasonable expectations... or something like that. i had a real peach of a 19 year old on my phone the other day who had just signed onto a lease for a brand new audi that he'd gotten with no consideration for the insurance. so he was going to be paying almost $300/mo, which he didn't forsee and was doing his damn best to treat me like i was the dumb one. the worst part was that he was being more than a little condescending, but the final straw was when he was reading me the vin (vehicle id number). the entire time, he sounded like he had me on speaker inside a wind tunnel, so i asked him to give me the vin phonetically. i kept reading back to verify, but the vin just wasn't validating. finally, i dragged him through it a 4th time only to find out that instead of saying ""s as in sam"" like any of my other thousands of customers over the years, he was saying ""f as in fam"".  and again, he treated me like i was the idiot.~~Me: Hi, Dr is calling to request a roadside assistance. Dr provides all the details and I put his request through. Dr is not happy with the waiting time and argues he should be prioritised because he is a doctor. I explain to Dr that we don't prioritise anyone. Dr hangs up.~~Lyingmoron calls **** to complain about being charged $170 for the annual renewal of her roadside assistance plan. Noodles explains that the charge is for the highest tier membership with two people on it. Lyingmoron claims she received a promotion in the mail saying she could upgrade free until renewal and then she would be charged the full price. Noodles offers a prorated refund, but Lyingmoron is not satisfied and wants to speak to a manager.~~A member called our emergency roadside assistance hotline because he wanted to donate a car to a charity. The car had no plates on it, so I couldn't help him. He was furious about it and kept insisting that I violate the rules for him, since he's a lawyer and knows his rights. I refused and suggested he get temporary plates. He was even more angry and started threatening me and my company with a lawsuit.~~I was working for a roadside assistance call center when a call comes in to my line. Upset customer keeps asking to be taken off of the automated menu, to which I confirm that she is talking to a person. I ask her what the problem was, to which she said that she locked her keys in her car. I don't remember exactly where they were, but I remember confirming that they were not in the trunk. At this time, I begin looking for providers who are covered under our company's contracts, but this person lived in an area where there were no providers under contract. I ask a team lead if it was ok to look out of network, which thankfully was approved. I found a shop near her house willing to do the job. During this time, we had to see if they accepted our purchase order, and if they did not, we had to look elsewhere. Thankfully, not only did the guy accept our purchase order, but he said that he will do it for the contracted rate and that he could be there in less than 20 minutes.~~Customer service is a tough gig. You have to deal with angry people all day. Some of them are unreasonable and some of them are just straight up crazy. But every now and then you get a call that makes you question humanity.

5.0,"i work in the call center for a nation wide construction company. we have yards scattered all throughout the us but headquarters, where i am located, takes all of the calls for every little thing. the yards do not take inbound calls from customers, they typically make outbound calls to their employees and coworkers. 

ive dealt with bad customers before but never have i actually been sworn at... except by this one guy. 

m- me

m: thank you for calling mycompany, how may i help you today?

r: transfer me to them now.

m: im sorry sir, transfer you to who?

r: the yard.

m: our yards do not typically take calls as that is what we do. was there someone in particular that had called you about an issue?~~So I work as a taxi dispatcher in our call center office in Canada. I won't specify the city. But we constantly get angry calls (probably 10 an hour) about our cabs being late or drivers being idiots. And yes, I'll be blunt...we have 2 stars on Google and our management isn't the best. Employees are rude to customers if customers are rude to them (which I kind of like). But honestly, a lot of the times, the customers are idiots as well. Not paying our drivers, getting into fights while on the phone...it's a hassle.~~Yesterday, a AAA member became irate when the AAA driver arrived to provide roadside assistance, but was unable to do so because the member did not have her identification on her. The driver explained that this was a new company policy, put into effect to prevent fraudulent activity. The member became even more upset when she called the AAA office and was told the same thing. She then called back six times, each time becoming increasingly belligerent and, at one point, even threatening the AAA employee.~~A member calls in to have his car towed. Not a problem, we do this all time. Except this guy was a massive prick. He must have already been pissed off before he called because this guy was so irritable. Constant frustrated sighs, an angry tone, dropping a liberal amount of f bombs, and snapping at me for the dumbest things. For example I asked him for his vehicle information and his reply was ""Can't you see it on my file?"". In between his angry/snappy comments and angry sighs, I manage to piece together his story. He had actually had his car towed earlier that day, but the garage he been towed to was charging him a crazy price for repairs so he wanted to get towed elsewhere so he could get a better price. This is one of those things that's against regulations, we don't do retows. For example, if a member gets towed from a to b, and then later wants to towed from b to c, their membership would not cover that second tow.~~A wife called her husband's roadside assistance company to have his car towed from the dealership to a different repair shop. The wife was upset that the company called the dealership and ""went behind her back and called the dealership."" The wife claimed that just because the dealership couldn't use used parts, that they couldn't fix the car. The company explained that her membership only covered towing to a repair shop, not price shopping. The wife was not happy and cancelled her membership.~~A woman working for an emergency roadside service line has shared a comical exchange she had with an angry motorist. The man had called the company to have his car towed. However, when the woman told him he could not ride in the tow truck to his chosen garage and then have the driver drop him off at home afterwards, he became irate. The woman remained calm and professional throughout the call.~~Dumbass calls roadside assistance company. Dumbass wants to know the benefits of her membership. Dumbass also wants to renew her driver's license and registration. Dumbass gets angry at the operator because she can't help her with everything.~~A woman called emergency roadside assistance to have her car towed. The car was in a parking lot and she needed it moved to the other side of the lot while the lot was being repaved. She claimed the car belonged to her cousin and that she did not have the key to the car. After several failed attempts to explain to the woman that they could not help her, the woman became irate and hung up on the operator.~~A few months ago I received a call from a man who asked if I could open up his mother-in-law's account and remove a vehicle that was listed. He said she's planning on selling it. Due to privacy law, I cannot speak to anyone other than the account holder unless they are listed as an authority or I speak with the account holder first. I explained this to the man and he said (hesitantly) that I can call her to gain access to the account. He then goes on a spiel about how she is selling the car to use the money to make a statue in honour of her dead husband. Upon ringing this lady and explaining the situation and what her son-in-law was attempting to do with the account, she flipped, 'No, please do not remove this car, I am in no way planning on selling it, he is lying and I am going to call him right now and ask what the hell is going on'. I go back to the man and say, 'She said no, so I will not be able to make changes to the account', to which he says 'Okay, thanks'.~~Customer calls to complain about being charged extra for bringing a van back late.

Noodles_the_food then needs to speak to Am's supervisor.~~This story was shared on Reddit by a user who works for a company that provides emergency roadside service. It's a long read but it's worth it. Enjoy! The thing is, we will not tow your shop off of the lot of a closed repair facility unless you have some sort of proof, like a receipt, that proves you don't owe the shop any money. If it's not obvious, we have this rule because people have tried to get out of paying a bill by having us tow the vehicle for them. This is theft obviously so to cover our behinds, we won't tow it unless you have a receipt or something to show no outstanding bill. (also side note, if you break down and go to pull off the road, if you can, avoid pulling into a repair shop if you know it's closed because of this...~~A lady called the trash company because a squirrel chewed a hole in her trash can lid. It was also covered in blood. The company would replace the lid for free, but not the whole can. The lady refused to clean the can herself, so the company refused to help her.~~Richard Derp called roadside assistance for a 40 point inspection for his car. Noodles answered the call and asked for his account information to verify his identity. Richard Derp became angry and refused to give Noodles the information she asked for. Noodles couldn't help Richard Derp without the information she asked for and he refused to give her, so he hung up.~~My favorite part of working in a call center is the customers. Without them, I'd just be sitting in a chair, staring at a computer screen. Instead, I get to talk to people from all walks of life. I've helped people fix their computer issues, helped people understand their medical bills, and even helped people figure out why their parking plan doesn't cover toll booth fees. But, my favorite call of all time was from a lady who called because her card was declining at a toll booth. She had a parking plan, and she was trying to use her card to pay a toll fare.~~AIBU to vent a little? I work in a premium car brand which is known for assholes drivers. as a worker, I consider myself good at finding solutions at work even in difficult circumstances. this morning, a man called the hotline in a very rude and condescending manner.~~A tow truck driver in Florida was hit by a drunk driver and had his foot nearly severed. The driver works for a company that responds to breakdowns and accidents. He was outside of his truck loading a car onto the truck when the accident occurred. The driver of the other car was allegedly drunk and driving at a high rate of speed. He hit the tow truck driver and then hit the car that the tow truck driver was loading. The force of the impact pushed the car into the tow truck driver, pinning him between the car and the truck. The tow truck driver had to have his foot partially amputated.~~A woman called a roadside assistance company. She was crying and upset. She needed fuel delivered to her but she ran out of gas. She explained that someone had siphoned her fuel. The operator asked for her vehicle type. She replied: ""I don't know."" The operator asked for her license plate number. She replied: ""I don't know."" The operator asked for her location. She replied: ""I don't know.~~A member called in earlier today and ended up getting transferred to my supervisor (sup) because she wasn't happy that we were telling her, her request wasn't covered. the lady wanted our driver to pick up her and her husband, along with their dogs and tow the vehicle to the repair shop. she then wanted the driver to wait while the shop looked at the veh to see if they could fix it or not. if they couldn't she wanted the driver to then tow them to the airport so they could get a rental and wait while they unloaded the vehicle and then tow the vehicle to a tow dest 2 states away. obviously, this is not covered. the drivers are not taxi cabs and we have other members waiting for service so we can't have a driver tied up for so long.~~The busiest time for motor insurance claims is between 5pm and 6pm on a Saturday, according to a new report by MoneySupermarket.com.

So I look at the notes. ea called at 18.15h asking for a towing service. We also always ask if the ocupants need transport back home (or whatever they want to go), the operator wrote on file that she said she had a ride from a family member and transport wasn't needed. It's now 20.15h, so she actually has been waiting for only one hour since she asked for the cab. I see confirmation that the cab was sent, but she's also in an area full of traffic. I'm not gonna disturb the poor driver on its way for this.~~This is a story about a time I worked for a trash hauler.

Better pay, better hours, better benefits and full time! I salute all of you who are still in the trenches fielding those frustrating calls. I salute those of you who have left and moved on. I salute the newcomers and the veterans. I respect those of you who chose this work and choose to stay. You're stronger of will than I am.~~So I used to work for a luxury car brand in their call center. Said luxury car brand had many problems with their brakes being too loud when it was wet outside.~~I work in a call center selling auto insurance. Today a lady called wanting to buy a policy for her financed vehicle. The car was not in her name, it was in the name of the bank that financed it.

She did not want to pay the extra money and tried to lie her way out of it.~~Ac is angry because he was quoted for $2100 but now they are saying it is $4600.

but people never do that. they think the base model vehicle with no features should be the same price as the vehicle fully loaded. whatever.

i had a guy come in today very accusingly asking me why our vehicle was priced $10,000 more than what they could build it on the manufacturer's website??? (spoiler: the vehicle they were looking at was only $5,000 less.... don't bullshit me please, i'm not an idiot.~~Insurance is one of those things that you hate paying for but are very happy you have when something bad happens. Or when you get a ticket. Or when someone dings your car in the parking lot and doesn't leave a note. Or when you lend your car to your friend who then gets in a wreck. Or, or, or...

5.0,"I work at a call center for an auto manufacturer. Occasionally customers call in asking for radio codes. In order to recover the radio code, the customer must provide the radio serial number. Usually, we can generate the serial number electronically by walking the customer through a simple process. However, this process does not work on certain model years, and when that happens, the only way to recover the serial number is to have a mechanic pull the radio out of the dashboard to read the sticker on the back. A mechanic just called in to recover a radio code for one of his customers. He handed her the phone, and she and I determined that the electronic retrieval process would not work on her model year. I told her she would have to call back after removing the unit from the dash.~~I work for a large membership based national emergency road service club. my job is to take the info from people who are broken down about their location, vehicle, amd where they would like it towed, etc. this story happened on my friday (which was actually wednesday) before i was supposed to leave work. the next day i was planning on going to the emerald city comic con. the first day of the con. this is important.~~I work for a towing company and I had to call a member who needed a winch out. He got stuck on one of those concrete barriers they use for parking spaces. He wanted us to lift the vehicle up so that it would come loose and he could continue on his way. I had to explain to him that we don't cover a winch if it requires to be lifted and explained why. This guy was not happy. He kept saying that he wanted someone to lift and not drag it. I kept saying that it's not covered and that we can drag it but can't lift it. So he says ""I'm going to explain this for the 3rd time since you don't seem to be listening to me. I said that I don't want my car dragged and that I need it lifted. If you have to send a rollback to load me onto the truck and just tow me 10ft then do that but I need my car lifted."" I explained that, that isn't covered either. We're not towing his vehicle 10ft. either he can pay for the winch himself or let us drag it.~~A taxi driver has his car stolen. He calls the support line for the maintenance program his taxi company uses. That support line is handled by my company. We don't handle the drivers, only the locations that do maintenance on the cars. So this poor guy calls the wrong support line, and I have to tell him we can't help him.~~A guy calls the train company hotline to report a lost backpack. The backpack contains drugs. Vorador, the person on the other end of the line, has to fill out a lost and found form and send it to the train personal. They will contact the guy when they find the backpack.~~Caller is in a ditch. He is at the top of the ditch. He is worried there are people with accidents and old people ahead of him. He has a cat in the car.~~So I work in a car rental office. I got a call from someone who rented a car a week ago and gave the car to his nephew. His nephew went missing and the uncle is worried he might do something stupid. The car has a GPS tracker but it's not activated unless a police report is filed. The uncle doesn't want to file a police report yet in case his nephew shows up. I talked to him twice and extended the rental for him. I really hope the nephew is found safe.~~Customer returned to the parking lot where he left his car, but couldn't find it. He was 100% sure he was in the right spot, but due to the circumstances he called us to locate the vehicle for him. He was under the impression that we place GPS devices on our vehicles to locate them at any time. We don't. When the agent told him that it was not possible to do that and suggested that he contacted the police, the customer requested a supervisor.~~I work for a fleet management company. We handle our clients' drivers who have flat tires, accidents, etc. in company vehicles. We also handle their glass repairs and rentals. It's a 24/7 operation and can be hectic at times. I'm sure you can imagine. Anywho, I had a driver who hit a pot hole. He was cool with us changing his tire on the side of the road or towing him home. I set up the tow and got him a ride to his house. He called later and was livid. He wanted us to tow him to a tire shop so he could get his tire changed. I explained that we couldn't due to location and time of day. He was not having it and kept yelling. He eventually got me to agree to tow him to the tire shop. I noted in his file that it was per his request.~~So I work at a call center that dispatches roadside assistance if people breakdown/need towing as well as offering minor technical advice. A lady calls up on x car manufacturer's line letting us know she's been in an accident. We don't do accident roadside and always direct them to their insurance so they can claim and get their assistance covered. I tell the lady this and it goes as follows: Lady: Well, that's fine, whatever, it was only a little ding and I drove away anyway. Me: Did you get the other party's details for an insurance claim? Lady: No, I drove off. But it's x manufacturer's fault I crashed! The car rolled backward when it shouldn't have. Me: ... What? Lady: No, I wasn't accelerating and of course not braking I just started the car and got ready to go! And you should be paying for this since it's a technical fault with the car.~~A customer has written a very long email complaining about the lack of assistance when their car broke down. They were going over to another city where they had booked a hotel, and were now stranded on the road. I checked all the relevant information - the customer claimed they called assistance several times and no one wanted to help. They also claimed that the assistance department told them they couldn't help them in any way and didn't want to go to where they were. A tow truck finally went to them and towed the vehicle. They were told that a replacement would be given the next morning, as it was quite late and no nearby stations were open. The customer threw a fit and assistance said they could arrange for a taxi and that we would refund the amount. They agreed.~~I work for aaa roadside assistance and towing. I'm a dispatcher. The company recently bought a new system called fsl. It's garbage. It's created 3x the amount of work for us dispatchers. Members are waiting hours for help. I've been having meltdowns over stupid stuff. It's effecting me at home. I've decided to leave. My last day is next friday. I'm so relieved.~~Hi. I work for emergency roadside assistance (ers) and that means I get to deal with all the lovely people who call when stranded. Now granted, situations on the highway are extremely unnerving but I would like it if the member for once understood I don't have a tow truck chasing their ass so they need to give me at least a hint of where they are. I answer the phone, give my greeting, ask if they're somewhere safe, they answer no, they are in a highway. Got it. Make it a priority call.~~I work in emergency road service as a dispatcher. One day, a member called in and requested a tow. The driver went to the location to tow the vehicle but the member ended up threatening the driver with a gun because the tags on the vehicle had expired. The member called back and requested another garage. We explained to her that she was not getting service because of the threat she had made. She argued that she didn't threaten anyone and that she was going to shoot the driver if he touched her car, because the gun was registered to her.~~I work in an office.

5.0,"My friend works as a dispatcher for a towing company. One of their drivers got on location for a call. When he arrived, the member left and left behind a female who they later find out was his wife. He hooked up the vehicle to his truck and was all set to go but the members wife went into his truck and took his truck keys, his phone, his work tablet, and his personal keys. Then she was climbing on the back of his truck which is not allowed. She was trying to say that she needed stuff out of the car, which was already hooked up. This is not allowed for safety issues. He kept telling her to get down but she wouldn't listen and ended up getting belligerent. She was screaming so loud, that my friend could hear her in the background when the driver called in. Obviously, the police were called. She threatened to shoot the police. The police ended up needing backup because she was just so crazy.

I've been dealing with angry customers up the wazoo lately, because we don't have enough calltakers to handle our heavy call volume. A customer calls in, saying he was lazy and decided to hook his arm through the open window and unlock the car from the inside. This unsurprisingly set off the security system, and he needs our help. I'm trained on how to do security resets for all different types of cars, so I spend an hour and a half with him trying to walk him through resetting the security system. To no avail, the light will not turn off, the horn keeps blaring. But the entire call he's just so polite and apologetic.~~A conversation between a member of the public and a call centre worker about the disruption to tram services due to planned works. The member of the public wants to know whether she can get a tram between certain stops. The call centre worker gives her contradictory answers and becomes increasingly impatient. The conversation ends with the member of the public hanging up.~~A member called for a tow. When the representative got to the part about asking if the member had a mask, the member said yes and made a comment about if not he'll just bring his gun or something along those lines. The representative put the call in after making sure to notate what he said. Another dispatcher called the member back to clarify what he meant but the guy became argumentative and defensive about the situation and kept saying that if we don't want to send service that he doesn't need us and he has someone else that can do his tow. His account has been sent to escalations for review.~~I work in an office where I answer the phone for several different businesses.  One of the businesses is a towing company.  I took a call the other day from a woman who was very upset.  She had just gotten a flat tire on her way home from work.  She was also 8 months pregnant.  I got her number and a tow truck was sent out to her immediately.  About an hour later I got a phone call from the same woman.  She was even more upset.  The tow truck driver had shown up, but would not help her because she was pregnant.  She was crying and I could barely understand what she was saying.  I got the tow truck driver on the phone and he said that he would not help her because he did not want to get his truck dirty.  I told him that he was being ridiculous and that I would talk to his boss.  I got the boss on the phone and he said that he would send out another truck, but it would take some time because all of their trucks were currently in use.  I told him that the woman was pregnant and needed help right away.

6.0,"I work in telecom. A customer called demanding a replacement phone for her Galaxy S8 because the Bluetooth doesn't work. After some questions, I found out that the customer had never paired her phone with the car, but was convinced that she shouldn't have to. I asked her to contact the car dealership, since they had set it up the first time. She got angrier and angrier, and shouted her name at the car. The car recorded her shouting and played it back to her. She got quiet and uncomfortable, and we ended the call shortly after that.~~So I work for one of the big wireless providers in customer service. every now and then you'll get a call with content charges on the bill from google play and the microsoft store. lady called in livid about a $75 charge for fortnight on her bill and disputing it.~~A woman called complaining about fraudulent charges on her son's phone. He's never been to Canada, so there's no way the phone was cloned, it must have been stolen. Right?  Well, the calls were all made from Canada, and one of them was to the mother's phone. But the kid was on a church trip to Missouri!  There's no way he could have made those calls from Canada, it must have been stolen. Right?~~A phone company worker in the UK has some advice for cheaters: Don't let your girlfriend look at your phone bill.  Apparently the guy was trying to pull a fast one on his girlfriend by having a second phone line.  Unfortunately for him, his girlfriend was a lot smarter and started looking through his bills.  She quickly found out about the second line and then proceeded to flip out on the phone with the guy who set up the second line.~~A customer called cell phone tech support (me) complaining about her modem. She said it was giving her veins in her legs and headaches. I told her there's nothing I can do about that, as I do tech support for cells phones. She insisted that I help her, so I had her turn it off and on.~~A lady called in, saying her husband's phone was malfunctioning, that or the towers in a few towns were fraudulently billing her husband's phone for calls he wasn't making while he was driving near them. This was before unlimited roaming, and when some more rural areas didn't have good phone coverage. She was looking at the cell phone bill and noticed her husband was getting roaming charges on his phone. sure enough, she looked at the bill, and most times he drove by this town, either way, he'd get a call billed from his phone to a number, always the same number, and it was in a roaming area so there would be a small charge for the call. I looked at the bill, I saw the same charges. I looked back at previous months bills, same charges, going back for months, a couple of times a week there was a call to this number passing through this small town along I-29 in South Dakota. Then she says she's talked to the wives of other truckers in the trucking company, and their husbands are apparently getting the same calls billed to their phone.~~I worked in a call center for a mobile phone company for a few months last year. I took a call one day from a mother who was very angry about her bill. I said I would go through her bill with her and work out where the extra cost has come from. As I'm reading down the list of numbers I notice that one of the family's several devices has had more charges on it for the past few months than it had been before. I inform the women that I have found a charge on the account under that specific number and she says well that's my son's number.~~Karen is very upset because she can't get the new iPhone 11 Pro until November.

Her phone was broken and she wanted a new one. Me and my manager explained to her that we couldn't give her a new phone for free. She was not happy and wanted to cancel her contract. We advised her that it would cost her a lot. She was even more frustrated. She wanted to speak to my manager. My manager called her back and the note she left said that the customer accepted our offer.~~I work for a wireless provider. Sales are so wildly important, reps will do anything to add a line of service. They will claim that they will get a free line or they have to add a line to get a special discount or promotion. There is no such thing as a free line and all promotions are avalible through regular upgrades. It usually takes our customers a couple months to realize they were lied to and by then, the rep has already gotten their comission. Sometimes reps will just add a line and hope the customer wont find out for 60 days, which happens all the time. Paperless billing and autopay assures that.~~A customer called to renew his contract. He was past due $400 so wasn't eligible for renewal. He'd made a payment via online banking, but it can take 2-3 days to process. The customer was insulting and screaming. He was put on hold to calm down, then hung up on.~~I worked in a call center for a popular cellular provider. The training was useless. We got paid next to nothing. Dealing with customers was a whole other level of hell. I absolutely despise customers. They are the worst.~~I work at an ISP/mobile provider. It's invoice time and every single month people are pissed because they used more than they had in their contracts. Asking at least half if not the whole invoice to be credited. With high enough invoices we give them a little back with a max of $20,- but it is never enough for those people. So I'm ruining the days and life's of people just because they don't want to pay attention or have the security options.~~I work for a Canadian cellphone company and I just had this customer on the phone that activated her phone line just today. She was coming from other company, lets call it ""Rufus Mobility"" and activating with our company, lets call it ""Relus Mobility"" and she ported in her number. As a basic standard phones are locked to the carrier provider and to use a phone with other company the phone needs to be unlocked first. So it goes like this. OP: Thanks for calling Relus Mobility, my name is OP, how are you doing today? C: Good. I just activated with your company, the sales man gave me a sim card but it is not working on my phone and now, not even my old sim card is working. OP: I'll be more than glad to help you with that, could you please tell me what is the error you are getting when turning on your device with your new sim card? C: It says something like Carrier Restricted. OP: Thank you for that information. C: The phone that I am using right now is a Rufus phone. OP: Have you checked with them if the phone is unlocked so it can take a sim card from other company?~~A guy calls his phone company to dispute a $5 charge. He was automatically upgraded to the next data plan, which he knew. The call center agent can't give him a credit because he used the new plan.

I explain that because the phones are on the lost/stolen list, they can't be activated on any carrier. I suggest that he turn the phones into the police or a store so we can get them back to the owners. He refuses and hangs up.~~I worked at a call center for a large cell phone company. This was about 5 years ago, so I don't remember the exact phone model. A customer called in because his phone was censoring his text messages. It would auto-correct certain words. I explained that the phone was probably on the newer side and thus didn't have the ability to remember the customer's typing habits. I walked the customer through the steps of entering words into his dictionary. The customer was polite but seemed to want to register a complaint with someone. I gave the customer the number to Samsung (the phone manufacturer). The customer thanked me and called Samsung.~~Large telecoms company. Get big uptick in fraud whenever a new iPhone releases. In 2 year review, has personally encountered blatant equipment fraud 4 times. This one was different because he recognised area code as hometown and tried to strike up conversation. Indian accent made it difficult to catch name, but no account came up, so he would match it with account info when he found it. Gave account holder's name as Rebecca. U/majahzi left a voicemail for Rebecca to call them or use her app to change her security information.~~A Canadian telecoms worker has shared a story about how he gave a US customer a $10 credit on her account, after she told him how much she loved Canada.

Poutine is a Canadian dish of chips, cheese curds and gravy.~~A demanding customer calls the telecom company because she believes she was wrongly charged $10 extra.

The balance forwarding was explained to him but he did not want to hear it and kept insisting on lowering the bill. He threatened the call center agent with suing the company. The call was transferred to the supervisor who also said no to Gordon.~~A dealer support rep for a Canadian telecom company got a call from a store. A customer came in wanting to change his plan. The customer has been with the company for 7 years. The plan the customer wanted was a loyalty offer only available to targeted customers.

I tend to like my job -- I rarely have rude customers, the metrics aren't ridiculously strict, and I get to crochet at my desk while on calls. Throughout these six months, though, the most frustrated I've ever been was talking to a woman with an iPad who couldn't plug in her headphones. After getting her name and callback number, our conversation went as follows: &gt;**me:** Thank you, ma'am. How can I help you today? &gt;**Lady:** I just purchased an iPad from Walmart, and there isn't anywhere to plug in my headphones. I want to listen to music on my iPad but there is no headphone hole. &gt; Internally, I'm thinking that maybe this lady is mixing up an iPad and an iPhone, so I ask for the serial number for the device and look it up.

One of my favourite call types was dealing with people who had been signed up to a premium sms service without their knowledge. This would usually involve dealing with an angry husband/wife who would deny all knowledge of the charges even though there was a clear paper trail. My favourite part was when I would eventually track down the company running the service and get them to conference call in. The look on their faces when they realised they had been caught was priceless.~~I used to work in an outbound callcenter. We were hired by a large cellphone company to do business acquisition for them. My job was to call consumer customers that had a business to try to get them on our business plan.

I reiterate that no further credits will be issued and if she wants to transfer carriers she will be liable for the $2,000 in phone installments on the account. She says she will transfer carriers.

My coworker works in retention and the customer (in her 70s) was calling from the hospital because her old phone had terrible service and she didn't want to pay for it anymore. She was getting ready for a major surgery and was starting to get concerned about bills and such, which is a completely reasonable reaction. You can tell she's kinda lonely there so they go through a lot of small talk about her hospital and the procedure while my coworker is looking for a good offer for her.

The company had a policy of giving a $25 credit for certain types of complaints. Most of the time, I gave $50. The point is, I had the authority to make the customer happy. And I did, every time.

I had a lady call me who was leaving an abusive relationship and trying to keep her and her son's phone lines active. She had a large balance to pay off (over $1000 that she had to borrow). She paid it and then her credit required a $400 security deposit. Credit conditions are non negotiable but I felt for this lady, trying to sort out everything to keep her and her son safe.

That's probably going to come back and bite me, but I wanted to help. Everything I tried failed and she gave me her credit card number through tears.

I pulled up her last bill. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. No over usage. No third-party charges. According to the service details, she had a $5 monthly discount that was expiring after that billing cycle. I explained to her that we send her the bill every month as a way of communicating with her and letting her know what's going on with her service. And if she had checked her bill that came out in June, she would have known her $5 discount was expiring. She refused to believe it and demanded $50 instead of $56. I transferred her to our customer relations department.~~disclaimer: while i worked for a wireless carrier and frequently worked with reps and supervisors, i was not a rep myself. a bit of background: years and years ago, no such thing as a nationwide wireless/cellular network existed. on a trip from, say, new orleans to houston, you'd go through five or six different coverage areas. some were owned by major corporations, others were regional or even locally owned. many smaller operators ran their own customer service locally. one friday after work i got a wild hair and decided to head to lake charles to see a buddy that'd moved there a few months ago, never mind the five hour drive. met up with him and we went for the casino boat. at the time, call delivery systems were in their infancy. you had to dial a * code to tell the system you were there and to send calls to you. except this wasn't working for me, as i found out when i stepped outside after losing a particularly large blackjack hand. checked voicemail and had a stack of messages, but the phone hadn't rung. so i 611.~~I work for a cell phone carrier, among other things handling lifeline (government subsidized cell service) customers. Most of them only speak Spanish, so we have an interpreter service. Today a lady called and I completely forgot that we had the interpreter service. I answered the phone, ""Hello ma'am, how can I help you?"" She responded with something too fast for me to understand. I told her, ""I'm sorry ma'am, but I don't speak much Spanish and I need a translator."" I used the interpreter service and finished the call. My coworkers were staring at me. Apparently I had never told them that I have a degree in Spanish. I don't typically handle those calls because I get terribly nervous and stammer badly, which makes me more nervous, which makes the stammer worse. It just made me laugh that my mind went completely blank after doing this for six years, and that's how I handled it in my moment of panic.","The underwear guy~~Why should I pay for a phone I don't have!~~Offering you a deal is blackmail.~~If you tell them something is illegal, why do they keep pushing you to do it?~~An honest customer~~I need service now!

(i strongly suspect it was the customer's fault, but of course you can't say that). basically, he was being given the high speed service, so he was being charged for the high speed service. what he insisted he'd asked for was the standard service, at the standard service price. and now he wanted a refund of the difference between the two prices, for the three or four months he'd been receiving the ""wrong"" service. that wasn't going to happen: 1. whoever had made the mistake, it wasn't us. 2. this had been going on for three or four months, and he had called us multiple times to complain about it over the course of that time. 3. at any time he could have asked to change his plan, we would have done it, and the problem would have stopped right there. but he never once asked. 4. he had been advised multiple times that he needed to take the issue up with the third party company who processed his application.~~*me: hi, thank you for calling (insert job here), my name is wheresunshine. can i get your phone number starting with the area code please?* *(customer gives me their information and verification) *me: thank you. how can i assist you today?* *(customer): ugh. i can't believe this. is this white pages?* *me: oh, this is not white pages, this is (cell phone provider) hotline number. *customer: i can't believe you're lying to me. you're secretly a white pages representative aren't you?* *me: i'm definitely not lying to you. the number you dialed is (cell phone's provider) hotline number. *customer: i didn't dial anything. i got transferred from a white pages representative. they told me they were transferring me to (cell phone provider). but i know you aren't a representative from them. you work at white pages. you're lying to me.~~A woman called tech support because her business phone wasn't working.

Most carriers now check your account history etc to determine if you qualify to finance a phone with them. Its literally risk assessment for a loan. Today I got a call transferred to me from billing (?!?). The customer wanted to know why she couldn't finance a new phone. Her limit had been lowered to $400 and she had a current limit of -$408, which was based on the phones she already was financing from before. I noticed the main reason it went down was because the bill had never been paid on time. I explained that meant she couldn't finance a new phone because the approved amount was -$8.00, literally in the negative. For about 10 minutes, we went back and forth with me trying to explain this means she must pay the full amount of the phone she chose.~~Yesterday I received a call from a customer who wanted to suspend his line while he was out of the country. He was under contract and had recently upgraded his phone. I explained that he would still be responsible for paying his monthly bill, but he would not be able to use the service.

Customer has an attitude from the start of the call. After some discussion, it turns out that the customer purchased a new device instead of having the power button repaired on his original device, because the nearest store is 30 miles away.

As a result, the company had to retrain all its staff and there was talk of potential lawsuits and firings. The incident took place in the early 2000s, when Paltrow and husband Chris Martin were still married.~~I work in a call center. It's not as bad as it sounds. I know people hate calling call centers but I quite like it. It's not the most challenging job in the world but it's not bad either.

He also has a binding period active that only ends next year, meaning he will have to pay over €100 in penalty if he cancels his contract. I explain this to the client. He refuses to pay the repair fees, as he feels they are excessive. I explain that repair fees are nothing to do with my department. The client becomes angry and frustrated.

The client eventually understands and decides to port his number to a different company.~~A customer was billed for her first day of service + one month in advance. She didn't like this one bit. Was screaming and hollering about how I was trying to swindle her out of money. Her plan was $80 a month. She was billed pocket change for one day of service in addition to that. I tried like 8 different ways to explain the concept of proration and how it was applied in her bill, and that she was in fact only being charged for exactly what services she had (1 day) and would have (month in advance). I tried explaining the math, the concept, and the consequences. It only made her angrier.

This guy comes through, gets quoted the 15% discounted price, and has a tantrum because the price is too high. He then says that other providers provide a 30% discount, and that he'll go with them instead. I can't remember exactly how the conversation went, but it went something like this: ""I'm sorry but unfortunately we wouldn't be able to do the same"". ""Even though you did it before?"" ""Yes because we have since added thousands of other workplaces to the discount scheme so more people can benefit, rather than just the army"". ""So you're saying you don't support the army then?"" ""No, that's why we're still offering you 15% off"".~~This is a story about a man who wanted to cancel his service because his phone broke and he couldn't upgrade without changing his plan. He was on a plan that was obsolete and once changed or cancelled, couldn't be reinstated. He was a long-time customer, over a decade, and had never missed a payment or had any issues. I apologized for the inconvenience and began explaining why he would have to upgrade his plan. I told him that I could offer him a similar plan for just a few more dollars a month and I could place a permanent credit which would bring the plan to the same amount he was currently paying. He was satisfied with that offer.~~unreasonable boar calls to cancel the lines of her fiancee who had three of his devices stolen. Klutch tells her that there will be early termination fees for two of the lines and a buyout for the other, totaling around $600 dollars. unreasonable boar is not going to pay that. Her account has been open for six months. Klutch is more than willing to assist her with her insurance claim but not going to waive early termination fees. unreasonable boar will leave the cell phone company.~~I work as a customer care consultant for one of the big telecommunication networks in Canada. I handle pretty much anything but tech support issues, so I've got a real big list of situations I have to deal with. Midway through my shift, I got a call from a customer freaking out because his bill is $10 higher than normal. He states that he called in a month ago and got a new promotion on his account, but it's not showing up in his bill.~~I worked in tech support for an American cell service provider. Most of our sites were in the US but we did have some locations in the Philippines. If customers became angry and demanded to speak to an American, the Philippines-based reps would immediately transfer the call to us. I received one such transfer and the rep was audibly shaken up, telling me that the customer refused to give information and demanded to speak to an American. So here we are: Me: Hi! Thank you for calling $company about your wireless service. My name is $firstname $lastname, may I have the number we're working with, please; area code first. Caller: No! I want an American! Me: Okay. My name is $(admittedly unusual) firstname $(admittedly unusual) lastname. May I have the number we are working with, please; area code first. Caller: No! I want a white person!~~A man phones a UK mobile phone provider to get a content restriction removed from his tablet. The security check goes by effortlessly. The agent helps the man fill in a form with his date of birth, and the restriction will be removed within 24 hours. The man then asks the agent to check his wife's tariff.~~So I get a call through from a customer who just upgraded his handset, however the sim in the new handset hasn't activated after 48 hours. We're just the manufacturer, so any carrier issues like this I'd usually have to refer to his network, however something he said made me think... &gt;sir, you said the old device is still getting service, correct? &gt;yes &gt;so you have the original sim card in the old device? &gt;yes &gt;okay well, what I'd suggest personally would be to remove the sim card from the old device so that the new sim card activates correctly. Because it's being used in the old device it may be preventing the new sim from activating. Unfortunately beyond that, this is a carrier issue and you'd need to speak to them to find out what the problem is.~~I work for a cellular company in the front-line support department. we handle everything from tech support to billing issues. i had a man transferred to me from our credit department in order to have his bill explained to him. his bill had been higher than normal the past few months and he needed me to tell him why. like any good agent i attempted to oblige the customer and pulled up his last bill. looks like he had done a back-dated price plan change, so we had ended up charging him the price difference for the last month, as well as the amount of the new plan for the current month. the bill before he had data overages; probably the reason he had his plan changed in the first place.~~A huge telco company outsourced their call center customer support to my company. We handled the mass market faqs. A customer called regarding his late payment bill. He was angry because he was only 3 months over due, but our company would only let the bill run up to 6 months. Our staff was exasperated.~~This story was originally posted on Quora, by Will O'Neill. While I was a B2B coach at a cell carrier, one of my agents involved me in her call because the shipping address didn't match any addresses on an account that was ordering 10 additional lines with smartphones, and she had a bad vibe. She stalled the caller while I called the primary to confirm. Predictably, they said they had no need of new phones. I told the rep to advise her caller that shipping was set up and ended the call.~~A lady called to see what price we can offer on our new data plans for her 3 cell phone lines.

7.0,"I don't know where to start. I'm 32, getting bullied in work and I honestly feel like crap because of it. I've worked in my current job for about 6 months now. For the first 3 months it was hard but I was getting bonus half the time. It all started to go wrong about 3 months ago when I got moved into a new team. It started out with things going missing from my desk. A marker, then my whiteboard for note taking, then my chillys bottle - it's a thermos bottle that cost about $25, but it's really special to me because it's a present my wife bought for me, it returned, dented. I was livid. My manager told them off when she saw I was upset. Then it got worse, they started throwing things at me. A stress ball, a pen, a golf ball, a half full bottle of water (not mine), even fruit. They've even thrown it at, and hit my groin in more than one occasion. My manager does nothing. A few days ago I snapped. I got hit in the groin again. I slammed my fist on the desk and said that's enough.~~I came back from lunch and found out my coworker died. It was sudden and unexpected. I have worked with this person for several years and they've worked for my center for over a decade. They were always working and didn't seem to take much time off, so I'm assuming this could have been stress related or health problems relating to stress. My center honestly couldn't give two sh*ts either. They don't care about us. This has really got me to thinking and feeling like my coworker never got to retire and actually enjoy life. I'm terrified but I have got to change my life and work on my resume asap to find another job.~~I work in a call center as a commercial (outbound). It's been a year and I'm 21 now but I feel 60. I sleep 4 hours, the stress is so high my hair is falling, I'm never happy, I feel depressed, I get angry at everything and it's all because of my job. I want to switch to inbound calls but I'm not sure. What do you think?~~I've been working at a call centre for unemployment insurance since mid 2018. as you can imagine 95% of our calls are extremely angry or really sad people. I took the month of February off because I'm feeling extremely burnt out. I'm anxious and depressed and I seriously blame all that on this job. I went back this week and the very first call I answered caused me to have a panic attack even though the caller was very nice and it was an easy call. I had to leave after that and I've been off again for the rest of this week.~~I worked at a call center for a year. It was the worst my depression had ever been and no amount of antidepressants could fix it. I stopped taking care of myself. I stopped caring to do homework for college. On my days off, I laid in bed and barely ate, or over-engorged myself every couple of days. My paychecks barely scraped over $100 and I burned through all of my PTO. I got sloppy with attendance and was nearing termination. It's a thankless job. The only human communication involved was when an angry customer screamed in my ear call after call. I would wake up crying before my shift and every second was agony. The pain in my chest never left and my mood was miserable. But I feel guilty. I feel weak for admitting I couldn't do it. And yet, a part of me is screaming, elated, free at last!~~I'm tired of surveys. More so, I'm tired of the weight they hold against you as an advisor. I've recently moved departments and I have gotten so many bad ones because people don't care that we are not the ones who make the policies. If I get one more coaching about positioning I think I'm going to lose my mind. It would be different if our managers had our backs when this happens but they always act like we could have done something better, even when there is not. I shouldn't feel like my job is on the line because of following procedure.~~I've been working in a call center for the past 3 or 4 years. The last two years have been brutal. I've had several mental breakdowns along the way. I'm abused daily by customers. My alcohol consumption has tripled. I absolutely hate my life. But I'm finally out. I went back to school 2 years ago. I've been working my absolute ass off every day since then. A few weeks ago, out of nowhere, I got an interview. In two weeks, I start my new job making an additional $20k/yr and never have to speak with another customer again.~~Hi, I've been working in a call center for a telecommunications provider for over 3 years. When I started, I felt energized and good. But now, I feel my mental health declining. I'm constantly tired, even when I get a lot of sleep. I don't have the focus or will to do squats, deadlifts, or bench. My relationship, which is going on 7 months, is declining. I'm not able to show empathy or sorrow. I'm looking for other jobs, but I'm stuck because I have a constant income and I need the money to survive.~~I worked at a very high volume call center. The pay was good, but the job was extremely stressful. I worked there for a year and a half and was about to go postal. I have bipolar type 2 and this job elevated every negative thought and feeling I had. I was constantly stressed and dreaded going to work. I would come home from work exhausted, mentally and physically drained. I'm sure most of you can relate. This job has an expiry date and I'm glad I got out when I did. I found a new job and I'm much happier.~~I just quit my bank call center job. I feel like I made a terrible mistake. The reason why I say that is due too I made $22.58 per hour. I've come a long way from my first call center making $11.00. I quit my bank call center job because I was tired of feeling suicidal. The job has left me so suicidal, I was sent to a mental hospital. I remember telling the counselor the reason why I decide to end myself is due too the stress I feel at this job. However, I feel like I make good money and I get 6 week off per year which is unheard of in the US. I guess what I'm asking is, did I destroy my life by quitting the best paying job?~~I worked in a call center for a year and a half. I was miserable, having had a mental breakdown mid-shift multiple days. I had to go back on SSRIs because of that job despite weaning myself off of them several years ago. When my boss called me in for a ""check-in"" meeting, I just looked so tired and defeated. I was lucky enough to get hired within two months for a customer support role that paid 40% more than what I made in the call center. Not only that, but the company didn't provide phone support, only emails. I cried out of relief and joy because I no longer had to dread the inevitable ringing that came in the moment I clocked into my old job.~~I just gave my notice at work. I've been wanting to do this for a while now, but I was waiting for the right moment. I'm tired of the drama, the gossip, and the negativity that comes with working in a call center. I'm ready to move on and start a new chapter in my life.~~I've had it. Just two more weeks and I'm free. My new job has no phone work and I feel so free and like all of my anxiety is completely gone. I've been at my job for 3 years and I was already burned out at the beginning of the year and this year was hell. Covid increased our call volumes by 500%. My job refused to hire any additional help saying it was too busy to train a new hire right now. Now our call volumes are up again because mail is really slow. My team lead and supervisor do not help in anyway except attend meetings all day and begrudgingly take supervisor calls.~~I've been at my call center where I do online banking for about 10 months. It's awful. I can't even enjoy my days off without getting anxious knowing I have to return to work the next day. Even just the thought of this job makes me sick to my stomach. I'm also pregnant and have a toddler at home, so I have to stick it out so I can get my 4 months of paid maternity leave in June. But I do plan on looking for work elsewhere while I'm on leave. My husband has worked for the same company also for the past 5 years, but he's in business banking.~~I left a job a month ago. I had been looking for another job for a few months and was getting really frustrated as I was unable to find anything. I eventually found a job and started a new role last week. It's an office job in admin. It's really different to my last job but I'm enjoying it so far. The people are lovely and my line manager is great. He bought me some lemsip when I was off sick last week and told me to go home. It's so weird actually being in a work place that actually cares about it's employees.~~American truckers are working overtime to keep the country's economy flowing as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. One LinkedIn user, who works in the trucking industry, started a thread to discuss the mental health impact the pandemic is having on truckers. The user, who has chosen to remain anonymous, wrote: ""I work in a call center for a major hauler and we are feeling serious pressure on a daily basis to work miracles for people. there just aren't enough drivers or inventory to complete the routes we currently have and to top it off, we acquired another company last fall, absorbing their customer base. obviously, growing a customer base and losing staff doesn't add up."" The post sparked a discussion among LinkedIn users, many of whom work in the trucking industry and have experienced similar issues.~~Hi guys. Its been two moths since i posted my last thread. I have finally quit my job in the call center. It took me 3 years and 8 months to finally do it. I still dont feel like I have quit and that I wont have to take calls from these terrible people. I know its probably going to take me a few days to finally realize this but I guess the job was so bad my brain cant move on right away. Regarding the relationship issues they are solved, all my problems till now, arguments with my girlfriend, or me just being depressed while in her presence were all because of the mental damage I have received working long term in a call center.

7.0,"I've been burning out slowly but surely since starting at my company. I feel trapped because it's a specialized role at a financial company. Pay is not that great. It stagnates and is hard to get much more. The company wants us to get 4 extra licenses for my role, which opens us up to more risk. This requires studying in our free time. It's the same pay as people who only have 1 license. None of this equals more money or pay. I wonder frequently if it's illegal to require us to study outside of work on our free time. It's a carrot that we will now be *considered* for a promotion someday. But the amount of people who get that promotion is really rare. I would rather just not strive for it. People with 20+ years don't have the promotion even though they do the same job of the higher level. My manager has been super aggressive for me to get the licenses and I've pushed back that it's not motivating.~~I work at a call center. I've been there for 2 years and have .5 (point 5) occurrences. I'm not sure what that means but I think it means I've missed less than 5 days of work in 2 years. I have a baby son at home and I just want to spend some time with my family, and relax, try and fit in some me time which I never get anymore. I always feel super guilty about calling in. What do you guys think?~~Working in a call centre was a mistake. I lasted two months before I quit. The job was fine, but the management was terrible. They didn't care about their employees. There was no work-life balance. The shifts were long and gruelling. And the worst part was that they didn't provide enough training. I was expected to know everything about the products and services that I was selling, but I didn't. I was constantly being criticised and put down. It was a very toxic environment.~~I worked in a call center for 5 years in my 20s. I was a top performer. I got sober and applied and got a job at a great call center making more money than I ever have before. I got through training with lots of anxiety. Now every day I fight dizziness, heart pounding, chest tightening anxiety. I shouldn't mind getting yelled at and figuring out bills, up selling. This is what I do and what I'm good at. Maybe I can't handle in my 30s what I excelled at in my 20s?~~I've been working from home since April 2020 and I've hated every minute of it. I've been anxious and depressed, and I've had panic attacks almost every day. I've lost weight and I can't sleep. I've begged my boss to let me come back to the office and she has ignored me. I've tried to tough it out because I'm the breadwinner and I have a family to support, but I can't do it anymore. So today, I sent an email to my boss resigning effective immediately. I have no idea what the future is going to hold, but at least now I have the space to explore other things.~~I used to love my job. Pre-COVID I had an amazing team, gorgeous campus, and I felt like I had a future. Now I cry before I clock in. I spent my ACW time crying, and I have anxiety attacks every single day. I used the last stimulus check and my taxes to pay my rent through the end of summer. I'm taking PTO this week and Monday I'll be resigning.~~I worked in a call center for a major credit card company for a few years. The company had a very high turnover rate, but the people that stayed (and got the better shifts and easier accounts) were the ones that partied with the managers. Drinking and pot were very prevalent, but the real drug of choice was prescription meds. There was an entire row of lockers that were just for prescription meds. I saw people take 2-4 Xanax, 2-4 Valium, and a handful of other prescription meds every day. Most of them were for anxiety and depression, but some were for ADHD and narcolepsy.~~I work at a rather large company and get yelled at 95% of the calls that I answer. I'm exhausted. I took this job as a transition job until I could find something else and I have no idea how people do this for longer than 3-4 months. I'm working out my notice and start a new job soon and I'm so excited to be as far away from customer service as possible.~~I've been in call center work for 2 and a half years now. I'm constantly being verbally abused by customers and I'm slowly dying inside. I haven't worked in almost 2 weeks because I'm barely able to tolerate it anymore. I feel stuck in this position. I'm currently filling out like 15+ apps a day hoping to get a call for a job some day. How do you all deal?~~A former call centre worker has described how she was driven to the brink of suicide by the stress and anxiety of her job. The woman, who has not been named, worked in a call centre for a mobile phone company in the Philippines. She has described how she would take time off work to visit a psychiatrist, and how she eventually quit because of the effect the job was having on her mental health. ""I was always in panic mode. I would shake and my heart would beat fast. I would get headaches and my body would ache. I would feel like I was going to throw up."" She describes how the management would not allow workers to take time off, and how the company did not provide health insurance. ""It was a very hostile environment. We were always being yelled at.~~I had a heated phone call earlier with a customer. He said he would find me and then he hung up. I'm wanting to know has there ever been cases of customers actually tracking and finding agents they've spoken to before? I'm struggling with depression and severe anxiety. My mental health is very low. I'm very tempted to quit my job, the only thing keeping me in it at the minute is the money. However, I feel as though I've prioritised earning money over looking after my health and well-being for too long.~~I worked at a car insurance call center for about a year. It was a pretty terrible job. The pay was good, but the work was monotonous and often involved dealing with angry people. I don't miss it at all.~~I had a panic attack and had to get medical assistance. I'm under anxiolytic treatment now. I had a bad time on my previous project. The metrics on the quality bonus were unrealistic. There's a new project with the same client. The training for the new project clashes with my vacation. I'm not sure if I want to stay in the company.~~I don't take off often, but today I feel lack of sleep. I thought my system wasnt working at first but come to realize I forgot a step in the process. My gut feeling told me to take some time off to rest. Lately I've been on top of my game but been struggling with sleep. I have been going through a lot of changes and also think this would be a good time to take some personal time to reflect and rest and we have been quite busy with new systems.~~I worked in an outbound call center for 5 years doing surveys and working as a pharma rep. I enjoyed it. Then I got a job in inbound customer service. I was excited because the pay was better. But I didn't realize how different it would be. I have a really hard time with the inbound calls. My heart races and I feel like I can't breathe. I've taken a mental health leave because of it. Does anyone have any advice on how they got over similar feelings?~~I worked in a call center for a little over two years. It was a job I took right out of college. I had been working there for a few months when I started to notice that I was developing anxiety and slight PTSD. I couldn't have a conversation on the phone without feeling like I had to get off the phone in a certain amount of time. If I didn't, I felt like I was going to get in trouble. I couldn't talk to my significant other or my family on the phone. It even got to the point where I didn't like talking on the phone to my mom. I started having anxiety attacks and had to go to the doctor. I'm just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience.~~I work in a call center. It's a job I fell into after I got laid off from my previous job. I was hired on a temporary basis, but after a few months they kept me on. I've been working there for about a year and a half. It's a job that I know a lot of people would hate. I don't make a lot of money, the hours are long, and I deal with a lot of angry people on the phone. It's mentally and emotionally exhausting. I've been thinking about quitting for a while, but I'm scared. I have a decent amount of student loan debt and I'm not sure I'll be able to find another job that pays as well as this one.~~I just had an epic breakdown and quit my 1 and 3/4 year work at home call center job. Already regret it and terrified for the future however im in a mental health crisis and im on my last legs with this company so there is nothing else i can do, really. No other path to follow that is better than this as theyve given me no outs.     Has/Have any other call center reps been in this situation? Calls ever really get to you so much that you break down? Just need someone to tell me itll be okay as I feel like I've burned any bridges that would have led to further gainful employment from any type of center now thanks to this.~~I worked at a call center for a large utility company for about 4 months. I quit when my son was born. About a month before I quit, I had a call with a woman who wasn't able to pay her bill on time because she and her son had to flee an abusive situation.

about 3 months ago i had a complete mental breakdown. the constant phone calls, short staffed, push for ot, micromanagement, unrealistic qa guidelines i just cant do it anymore. 

i was out on leave came back and was extremely triggered and had a panic attack. i had to call my therapist for an emergency session bc i couldnt calm down. since this job, ive had to go on ssris. this job started affecting my relationship so much so that i couldnt see how much i had changed and was neglecting my partner of ten years. current manager is a nightmare and does not have a single ounce of empathy. im treated like a number. im very much aware of how expendable i am. everything is over the computer/phone. no idea what some of my coworkers look like as we dont do zoom. im literally just an icon and a set of letters.~~I've worked in a call center for two years. I take 80-100 calls a day, and at least 60 of them are angry, abusive, and just downright unpleasant. I've stopped doing my schoolwork, I've started smoking again, and I can't use the phone when I get home because even just ordering pizza gives me anxiety. I'm irritable and short-tempered with my SO, and some days I can't even figure out how he puts up with it. Same for my friends.~~I'm about to go back to work after a 3 month break for mental health reasons. It's another call center, so I thought I'd share some stories from my last call center job. This is the first woman to make me cry on a call. This was my first job out of high school. A call center working for a health insurance company. It was week one on the phones after training and I was terrified. Always had anxiety, hated talking on the phone, etc. But this was the best job in my town and I knew I was lucky to get it.~~I just started a new job at a call center. I only have two days of experience but I feel absolutely miserable. I haven't been able to make any appointments and I feel like I'm just going to cry. The pay is good but I cannot imagine myself working here even for a month. 8 hours of calling people, looking at the clock constantly, waiting for it to be over. I come home and just cry.~~I work in customer service from home and I hate it. I have to force myself to get up and go to work. I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack every time I have to go to work. I don't take care of myself. I feel like I'm stuck at this job because nowhere else pays as well and offers benefits. I use unpaid sick leave so much that I can barely pay my bills now. I'm destroying my life to avoid another day.~~I've been contemplating leaving my company for a while now, but I always talk myself out of it because my job pays so much more than anything else in my area. I moved from a big city to a town in the midwest and work remote. I don't know about you guys, but telecommuting full time is soul-crushingly isolating and I can't wait to leave. I'm using the money to aggressively pay off my student loans, and I tell myself I'll quit once I'm debt free, but I feel like I won't find anything comparable unless I go back to school and accrue more debt!~~I worked in a call center for a little over six years. It was a high pressure environment, and I was handling it well, or so I thought. As the years went on, I hated the job more and more, to the point it started affecting my health. By the time I'd been there for six years, I had daily, long and painful headaches, my eyesight would cloud over, even though my eyes are fine. I was super stressed about the place, and super depressed as well. I would dread going in to work. Almost every day I wanted to be physically sick and would end up in tears. I ended up taking time off ill because my health was so bad, to the point of an MRI scan for the headaches.~~I was fired yesterday. I worked in a call center. It was my first job after a long period of unemployment and I was struggling to keep up with my targets. I have an ongoing ""disability"" which made constant sitting difficult and I take medication that certainly interfered with my work. I tried my best though and lasted almost a year. This was my first job after a period of very long term unemployment. I'm looking for work again (maybe not a call center) and I need to make myself look better. I'd rather work than go back on benefits.~~I've been in this job 3 months and basically haven't enjoyed a single day and keep thinking about quitting every day but keep grinding out each day and every day.

As a call centre there is a lot of sick leave, lucky I have paid sick leave but I'm still on probation so I don't know if this sick day is a mark against me. How do other agents get through the day? Do you all take sick leave once in a while due to burn out and have you been counselled for taking a sick day?~~I work at a call center for a major retailer. It's a seasonal gig that's allowed my significant other and I to get settled in a new state, but it's been a terrible experience. I work 10-12 hour shifts 3-5 times a week with 1 hour of driving each way. The commute and lack of sleep is wearing me down, but the worst part is the emotional strain. I've had terrible anxiety, multiple nightmares, and cried on the job. I've been called all sorts of awful names, handled some of the most batshit crazy people I've ever experienced, and still managed good sales, but emotionally, I'm wrecked. I've worked customer service for almost ten years and I know not to take this crap personally, but nothing could've prepared me for the abuse I received on the phone this holiday season - the volume of it especially. In a store, I'd get one or three bad eggs a day, but here it never seems to end. I take approximately 75-90 calls a day, depending on my hours, and that plus my commute and lack of sleep is clearly wearing out what I used to think was a pretty thick skin.~~Working in a call centre was a mistake. I didn't enjoy it at all. I felt overwhelmed, cried in the toilets and hated every minute. I didn't want to be there but I was so determined to see it through. I stuck it out for 4 weeks and quit. I'm so much happier now.~~I've been at my current call center for close to 5 months. There have been times where I felt changes in myself that I didn't like. Things like depression and anxiety. But I feel like I have a good handle on those things. Lately though, I feel like something is taking effect within me and I wanted to see if anybody else has experienced this, and what ultimately came of it.~~I recently quit my job. I was working in a call center for a large bank. I hated it. The stress was literally killing me. I was having panic attacks several times a week. My depression was at an all time high. I was on FMLA leave and my doctor told me that if I didn't quit, I was going to have a heart attack. So, I did.~~I work in a call center for a freight carrier company. I am expected to reach a certain number of call totals per day with a minimum average per month. It is giving me so much anxiety because if I can't reach those expectations I can't work from home anymore. I am in the middle of grieving the death of my little sister. I wish places like this would remember you can't just turn off grief, social anxiety, medical issues, or really anything that might hinder your ability to sit in one place for 9+ hours. I am so mentally drained and tired.~~The turnover at this call centre is crazy. People are hired by the dozens, with the expectation that maybe one or two will last until tier two. Training is back to back to back to back. Over the past year and a half, almost all of the people I started working with have quit. They either found something better or just couldn't take the stress. Now, what that leaves the centre with is one or two people that actually know what they are doing, and a mob of newbies that have to be supervised constantly as they're not even able to go through a call without putting the customer on hold and running around the floor looking for help. It. Sucks.~~Anyone else start experiencing diagnosable anxiety issues that you believe is stemming from your job? Since I started my call center job for a wireless provider, I am literally turning into a basket case. I'm on two different medications, and I am starting therapy for anxiety. I regularly have anxiety attacks at work. Every time a call rings in, I flinch and brace myself for verbal abuse. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Surely I'm not the only one?~~I started a job 2 months ago. It's a work from home job. I thought I would enjoy it. I was wrong. I hate it. It's the easiest job I've ever had. I feel so dumb for hating it because it's so easy. I just don't like talking on the phone. I'm an introvert. I thought I could handle it but I can't. I'm looking for another job.~~I worked for a funeral home for two years. I was their office manager and did everything from answering phones, to embalming, to cremating, to dealing with families, to paperwork, to ordering supplies, etc. I worked my scheduled shifts plus almost every weekend and almost every holiday. I was constantly being pushed to work more and more. I was always available and never said no. I got paid well and the money was good. But I was tired. I was stressed. I was depressed. I couldn't take the push anymore so I quit. I gave my two weeks notice. I feel like a failure. I feel like I let everyone down. I feel like I am a quitter.

7.0,"I work in a call center. I've been here for two years. I started in customer service and now I handle credit card applications for retail workers. The management is terrible. They appear once every two weeks and then send out reports and fail calls but never give us one on one time. They're constantly monitoring us and come around eyeing us down to see if we're doing our jobs and some of us are getting put on probation because we aren't meeting our quality but how is that expected of us if we haven't had a side by side with our manager in 6 months? I transferred to this department after being in customer service for a year and now I handle credit card applications and deal with retail workers and it's like every single call is me being screamed at along with management despising me. I've applied for 10 other departments and customer service was hard but at least I had supportive managers who helped me every step of the way this is just getting ridiculous.~~I work at a smaller call center and everyone is jumping ship. The work environment is hard and I suffer with severe depression. I have never had anxiety and depression to the degree I've been suffering for the past 6 months or so. Every single day I feel like I have to push myself to get up in the morning and I've called out of work just because I couldn't bear to even think about being there and dealing with it. I feel bad when I don't go, don't get me wrong. I was wondering if any of you had any experience with at-home jobs or anything like that?~~I work in a call center. I know, I know. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a good job, and I'm grateful to have it. But I hate it. I've been trying to find another job, but no luck so far. Meanwhile, I'm stuck at a job that I absolutely detest. I don't know how much longer I can take it.~~I have been working in different call centers for years, and I don't want to do it anymore. The sitting and csats are the worst. It seems like I'm stuck. I have a college degree, but I can't afford to go back to school. I also have a criminal background (a misdemeanor).~~I've been working a customer service job for two years now. It's as bad as everyone says it is. I've been trying to quit smoking for a few months now. I used to smoke a pack a day. I've been drinking a few shots of liquor a night instead. I don't like it because it's bad for my liver, heart, and has calories. It also makes me bloated. I've been trying to exercise to help but it doesn't help at all.~~I handed in my notice at work yesterday. I was supposed to stay 20 more working days, but I couldn't take it anymore. The anxiety got too much. I feel guilty, but I know it's the right decision. I'm sure I will find a new job. This time definitely not a call center.~~A former call center worker reflects on his time in the industry and why he left. He explains how the job affected his mental health and why he's now a truck driver. ""Keep the stories coming,"" he says.~~I've been working in a mortgage collections call center for the last 2 years. It's been the worst job I've ever had. The only reason I've stayed this long was for the bonuses and benefits. I got a job offer doing overnight stocking starting next Wednesday and I'm taking it. I don't care what the pay is, I need my mental health to be fine.~~I don't know how to collect my thoughts well. I've worked in this center for 2.5 years. The first year my manager was abrasive, mean, and constantly made myself and others cry. Said manager was demoted from our team. Though I no longer report to this person they like to make my life hell, and make the office a very hostile environment. It's affecting my concentration and performance. I've gone to HR. What do I do?~~I work in a call center for an electric company. It's a second job for me. I answer calls about outages, questions about accounts, and shut offs. I have had some really difficult calls lately. Today a man called and yelled at me for a solid 5 minutes about how we don't help people and only want their money. He was extremely rude. I tried to explain that there are programs to help people pay off their balances but he would not listen. He just kept yelling and saying he was going to sue me and the company. I had to hang up on him because he was making me cry. I love my job and I know a lot of people have it worse, but I don't know how much more of this I can take.~~I work at a call center for a large bank in the US. I started in February, two weeks before the pandemic started. We were sent home for training and came back during primary needs only. Now we're going back to business as usual. I don't remember any of the training and they haven't refreshed us. They also introduced stats without telling us what they were for or how to check them. There's also coaching which is just talking about what we're doing wrong. I feel like I'm constantly under pressure and I get yelled at a lot. I've started crying after calls and I dread going to work. I have friends at work but they don't understand. I'm applying for other jobs but I'm worried about the pay cut.~~I recently started a call center job. It was a bit stressful at first, but I eventually got the hang of it. I was feeling pretty comfortable with this job until I actually googled the company and realized the service I am selling is totally unnecessary and now I feel like I am stealing hundreds of dollars from innocent people. What makes this worse is that I usually get screamed at all day, but when I finally make a sale, it is usually from the friendliest people. I really like the job itself, but this bothers me enough to consider quitting.~~I've been working at this place for 6 months now and honestly it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. Recently, I've been getting migraines and dreading to go to work. There are barely people coming to my job and I heard that we are getting shut down since no one is coming. The management has been getting stricter even with less people. I just can't do it anymore. I've met a lot of great people and had some awesome supervisors. My favorite supervisor and friend quit and it went downhill from there. I'm sorry for the bad grammar. It's late and I'm currently experiencing a migraine.~~I work at a payday loan call center in the customer service department. We have no backup if someone calls out or quits. Our customers are rude, impatient, etc. I have no debt, I live at home with my family, and I have a decent amount of money saved.

It was a good job, but very stressful. There were metrics we had to meet, and it was high pressure. I didn't have a problem with it at first, but eventually I started obsessing about the past day, and how I might have messed up. The thoughts of me messing up consume me. I began to doubt myself more often now. I don't know what I think will happen, maybe I'll get fired or written up. I ruin my time after work and my weekends by having these thoughts rolling through my head.~~I've been in this industry for over a year now. I worked in food service before this.

I've posted about her before. she's a hypocritical bully. all she does is put people down and then brag about it. I'd report her but she's best friends with the head of my work so that's out. I nearly got fired by her recently after she asked my opinion about something and I was honest. I said that it's not a happy work environment and I even suggested some things that would help. minor stuff like an event every now and then. I was called a liar. to my face.

It's draining me mentally. I can't sleep at night because I just think about how I have to wake up and do the same thing tomorrow. I wake up every morning nauseous and sometimes I even throw up from anxiety. It's made me depressed. I don't want to do anything when I get off work or on weekends. It's the same thing just a different day, getting yelled at by assholes over things I can't control and then also getting bitched at by my manager for stats not being perfect or because I sounded like a robot with no emotions during my call.

I've written out my email notice ready to send but I'm scared and feeling guilty. There are people out there who can't get jobs and I'm thinking about quitting mine with nothing lined up.

I know it's not healthy to have a drink every night but I'm so stressed, drained, burned out, and frustrated by the time I get home.~~I hate my job. I work at a call center. 60% of the people who call in are assholes. I have to be constantly aware of what I say because one little thing could get me fired immediately. I'm constantly having panic attacks, and my depression has gotten substantially worse. I feel like I would rather drink myself to death than spend another day here.

I've been noticing a change in my mood whenever I have to go to work. I used to not mind going to work at all. In fact, I used to actually look forward to it. But now, I dread it. Every morning, I wake up feeling anxious about having to go to work. I don't know if it's just a phase or if I'm having a midlife crisis or what. I've been looking for other jobs, even ones that pay less than what I'm making now. I don't know if maybe I'm just new and it'll get easier or if this company just isn't the right fit for me. Any suggestions or comments?~~I have a job at a call center. I'm very lucky and will only have to work it for a month, but I'm worried. I have pretty bad social anxiety disorder. I have two more days of training and then I start the phones. I feel like I know absolutely nothing about the product. I'm so afraid I won't know what a customer is asking, or I'll give them the wrong information, or they'll be rude to me. Can anyone please give me any advice on dealing with rude customers? Also, is it normal to feel like you know nothing before getting on the phone? Does it get better? Are people really mean? Anything that might be able to help me relax for the next month or so would be wonderful.~~I've been doing support for a little over a year now, and it's starting to drive me crazy. I'm having some severe burnout, and my quality is going down. Aside from drinking copious amounts of alcohol, or just forcing myself mentally to remain positive among an onslaught of negativity/stupidity every day, what would you suggest to avoid burnout? I have a lot of hobbies, I am very active outside of work, hang out with friends, exercise, and spend a lot of time outdoors. I realized early on that coming home and watching TV or playing video games everyday would deteriorate my mental health extremely fast. Even though I do everything I can to enrich my life outside of work, it's extremely hard to stay positive and energized when I deal with the worst portion of humanity for 8 hours a day.~~I've been working at a call center for almost two years and I'm really good at it. My stats are great, my customer service is great, and my accidents are very minimal. I love my co-workers and my boss. But I'm going to put in my two weeks' notice today. I've never had a job where I've felt more trapped than in this one. Even when I get perfectly nice people and have an actually pleasant call with them, I feel as though I'm fake and of course repeating the same things constantly over and over again just with a different name and voice. I'm literally shaking with anxiety just talking to people on the phone. This isn't something that's new, I've always known I wouldn't be able to do this long-term. I just didn't think my own body would start to react to it in the way that it has.~~I work at a call center in human resources administration. The past several weeks I've been extremely ill with gastrointestinal issues and with a sinus and respiratory infection. I've had to call out most of the past three weeks due to feeling terrible. I was told they were planning on taking me on as permanent at the end of November, so I never signed up for coverage during open enrollment. The insurance situation is luckily being taken care of. I'm still stressing out because I haven't been making enough to pay my bills. I have no sick time so every day I lose is just lost. I'm getting ready to go in and the stress of knowing what's waiting for me, with the angry people and crappy management, that I'm terrified. And I'm sure stressing out isn't making this healing process any easier on my body. I wish I could just quit and get better. And never have to deal with that place again.~~I work in a call centre. I've been working there for 2 years and have always struggled with anxiety, but it's been getting worse lately. I had a panic attack in work a couple of weeks ago while I wasn't even on the phone. I got prescribed some meds but they didn't really work for me. I called in sick on Friday and today and called the doctor again. I guess being shouted at for 40 hours a week by ungrateful people has taken it's toll on my mental health. I explained that work is contributing significantly to my anxiety and she offered to give me a sick note so I can take the next couple of weeks off while I wait for the new meds to kick in! I have an appointment with them on Thursday to see if there's anything else they can do to help me but honestly, I just need some time away from this place and possibly to find a new job in the process.~~I have worked in a call center for almost 5 years, (i can almost here you gasping). it is killing me. i literally cannot find another job, and pray to get fired somedays at work. I work for a major clothing distribution company that handles multiple women's brands. three years ago i was ""promoted"" to a team that doesn't require phone work, but you do have to read some of the nastiest, petty emails from horrible women. we also have to take multiple live chats at time. the verbal abuse, pettiness, and just overall rudeness have killed my will to live. I am so exhausted, mentally and emotionally by the end of my work week that i don't do anything but lay on the couch on my days off.

I swear, if one more person hangs up on me i think my head might explode. ever since i started working extra hours (trying to save up for a trip i'm going on before school starts back up) i've been extremely irritable and have been having trouble keeping my cool with customers on the phone. its not the extra time working that's hard, its the constant being yelled at. on my normal shifts i only got yelled at by customers maybe twice a day if that, but i didn't work very often back then, and now i'm working so often that i get yelled at too often to count. its exhausting and i feel like my blood pressure is rising because of it.~~I've been working a new telephone banking job going on 4 months now. as you'd expect we don't get a calm day very often and these 10-12 hour shifts are enough to kill your social life eventually.~~I've been working at a call center for 4 years.

I don't like the people I work with. I don't like the work. I don't like my boss. I don't like coming here. I don't like staying here. I want to leave. I want out. I want to go home.~~I have been working at a call center for 4 months now. Every day I work I feel myself becoming more detached from reality and withdrawn. My drinking has increased a lot since I started. I now have an improperly working liver. I am at a point in life where I can't afford to quit financially however, I also do not want to do more damage to my liver.~~I work in a call center for a physical therapy company for auto injuries and talking to people about their tragedy is emotionally exhausting. I am intensely empathetic and love what I do. I love helping people. It is the only thing that gives me purpose. I pour my heart into my work and my patients and helping them through potentially one of the worst parts of their lives. They are often severely injured and have lost loved ones. I have done this for three months and I am just now comfortable with all of the details and technical work behind the job but I come home every day and could immediately fall asleep and sleep for ten hours easily. I have previously only had physically active to strenuous jobs and had so much energy all the time. I can barely cook dinner some days. How do you deal with the heaviness of knowing these people are suffering?~~I work in a call center. It's a job I love, but it can be very stressful. I have been off for over 3 months due to stress. I'm just getting worse and worse. I'm not the only one. Two people on my team have also gone on the sick for stress related issues.~~I worked at a call centre for the summer. It was alright at first but then I started to notice how badly the people were treated. My mom worked there for three years and has now quit due to being treated poorly. There have been a few calls that have made me laugh, angry, but there has been one call that has made me cry. I had an elderly woman call me sobbing that her doctor ignored her calls. She told me that she needed her medication or else she would start having her seizures.~~I lost my job due to covid-19 and have been working in an outbound call center doing mostly surveys since March. I was okay on the day shift, but have been moved to the evening shift and I'm miserable. The mental strain of talking to 100+ people every night, most of whom are rude and/or not interested, the noise from the 40-60 other people at work, the awful pay ($7/hr after tax), and being constantly monitored and listened in on is exhausting. I just want to quit, but I can't. I have no other means of supporting myself and the job market is dead in my area right now. I go back to school in the fall, so I just have to tough it out for a few more months.~~I work in a call center. I've been working there for a few months. I used to like it, but recently I've started hating it. I don't know what's wrong with me. I used to be a very outgoing person. I had lots of friends. I was the life of the party. But ever since I started working at the call center, I've become withdrawn and depressed. I don't know what's wrong with me. I used to be a very happy person.~~I've been working for a big bank for over a year now. at first in training i was excited, when i got in the floor i was terrified, my first 5 months were miserable, from 6 months to a year i was hopeful always thought i'd get to move up when i hit that mark, felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel. i had been given extra projects time off the phone to train new hires and lots of promises of promotions in my future. for a while i thought; good for me, i stuck with it even though it was hard and i cried in the bathroom and thought about crashing my own car, but i'm almost done. i was wrong, turns out the career path i planned on taking doesn't exist, my supervisors don't care if move up, and they've changed things a bit so no extra time off the phone. i've lost my hope, feel like i'm pretty close to being just another one ""out on medical leave for anxiety"" cause i'm totally miserable.~~I absolutely detest my job in the call center. I've been here for about 9 months and every single day gets worse. I've gotten panic attacks before coming in. I've started going to therapy as a result of the stress associated with this job. Weekends don't even feel like weekends. They feel like a breath of fresh air after being stuck underwater and drowning Monday through Friday. I want nothing more in this life than to quit and never look back. But it's not easy.~~I worked in a call center for a year. It was draining me. Every day, answering the same questions for angry customers, getting yelled at for things that weren't under my control or I could've fixed if they would've listened... I was training someone and my manager's manager came over and yelled at me in front of my trainee about something completely nonsensical. I nodded, apologized to my trainee and when the trainee left, I took a break. During that break, I called somewhere and got a job (I was told I could have the job whenever I wanted it). I came back in, left my ID badge, said goodbye to my neighbor and walked out. It took almost an hour for them to notice I was gone, and I turned off my phone so I don't know how many missed calls I got, but they were pleading me to come back. I just feel bad about feeling relieved? That's all I feel.","Those that lasted less than a year.

I have an accent, but I'm American born and raised. I'm originally from the midwest with mayo white parents. A racist bitch called today. I don't have much confidence in you, vogeltje. Can I speak to someone else?~~I worked in a call center for a little over a year. The majority of the calls I received were from Asian customers who spoke very little English. I understand that it is very frustrating not being able to communicate with someone and having to work through an interpreter. However, it is also very frustrating on our end trying to assist someone who speaks very little English. I would have to ask them to repeat themselves several times and still not have a clue as to what they were trying to say. It would literally take me an hour to assist some of these customers over the phone. I understand that it is a sensitive issue, but it would have made my job a lot easier if they had an interpreter on the line with me.~~I had to tell a lady the bad news that her husband was severely ill and she responded if the nurse could tell him that she loved him a lot and she was waiting for him along with their kids at home. I felt devastated. I tried to be as calm and compassionate as I was telling all that to her. The call didn't last longer. But that lingering feeling and I guess my error of getting in her shoes, was devastating.~~I had a customer who, after a few times of me trying to explain something to her in English, still wasn't understanding what I was explaining. I could clearly tell from her name and accent that she was Chinese because I speak Mandarin but not enough to have a conversation. Because she was having difficulty understanding me, I politely said ""Hey just wanted to mention that we do have reps who speak Cantonese and Mandarin in case you'd feel more comfortable speaking to someone in either of those languages"". ""How dare you assume that I have a language problem! You are so racist! You have horrible interpersonal skills!"" she screamed at me. I responded ""Ma'am, I'm very sorry if I offended you, I just wanted to make sure you were aware that we offered service in different languages in case you were unaware - I myself speak several languages and I know sometimes it can be easier to do things in a language I'm more comfortable in. I was just wanting to let you know that it was an option"". She screamed ""Let me talk to your manager!~~A man is sitting in a bar when he sees a spider on the floor.

The bartender says, ""You're not killing a spider, you're just making it angry.~~I worked in a call center. Most of our calls were from people who booked their trips themselves online, so you'd think they'd have at least some idea of where they chose to travel. Most of my calls were people calling during their travels about issues they wanted us to fix, 90% their own fault and very occasionally not. I'll save the longer stories for later but here's a short one that came to mind.~~Da placed an order for a toilet chair. The order was placed on Mr. Dumb Ass' account. Mrs. Dumb Ass called to complain that she didn't receive the toilet chair. Mrs. Dumb Ass spoke English the whole time and didn't need a translator.~~Racism is still an issue in America.  I work in a call center and get nasty calls occasionally.  Most of the time I can ignore it and move on, but sometimes it gets to me.  I had one lady tell me that I was a disgrace to my race and that I should be deported.  I had another lady tell me that I had a stupid accent and that she didn't want to talk to me anymore because I was hard to understand.  I've been working on my accent, but some people still have a hard time understanding me.~~I'm sick of my job. I'm a bilingual phone interpreter for deaf and speech impaired users. I've been harassed left and right, by both: deaf users and outbound callers. I've had a demented lady call numerous times to tell me to go back to my country and that Trump should've built that wall simply because the idiot kept dialing into a Spanish line. Deaf users who cuss at me because I don't understand the numbers coming out of their mouths, I'm working with what I'm able to hear. I'm not an ASL interpreter. The worst part is my management laughing things off and not giving us any kind of support or down time to cool off?! We're supposed to suck it up for the sake of accessibility.~~Polterg3istt is an Australian. The customer is also Australian and wants to speak to another Australian. Polterg3istt is based in Australia and has a very thick Aussie accent. The customer doesn't want to speak to Polterg3istt because of her foreign accent.~~My username is my actual first name. I was born and raised in America and the name, quite frankly, was made up by my parents and siblings. A lot of people say that it sounds Indian or Muslim so they assume that I am in another country when I answer. I take supervisor calls so when a representative needs a supervisor they transfer to me.

The woman, who has a non-American accent, said that as soon as she told customers something they didn't want to hear, they would start abusing her. ""No wonder you work in a call centre, you are so stupid"" and ""I can't understand you"" were among the insults she had to endure. She wasn't allowed to hang up even when threatened with death. Instead, she had to advise that she would transfer the customer to a support rep, if the customer agreed.~~Phone interpreter. Don't talk over me when I'm interpreting.

My husband asks for her account information so he may assist her. Caller hangs up.~~I work at a call center. A woman called in and asked to talk to a supervisor. I asked her what was wrong.

The car rental company I worked for had offices all over the world and on every continent. The employees were all required to speak English and whatever their native language was. It was nice when employees spoke more languages, but that wasn't a guarantee. The amount of people that would call or write emails to complain that no one spoke their language was insane.

A woman came through to me and I saw her language preference was French. Canada is officially bilingual and we do have French reps and I am definitely not one of them. She was speaking English to me and there didn't seem to be much of a language barrier at first. She wanted to go over stuff on her statement. I access it and see it's all in French. I offer to get her over to a French rep. She keeps asking for info and going on about a specific charge. I told her at least three times I cannot read the statement and she ignored me each time and kept talking. Finally when I mentioned for the fourth time I cannot read her statement because it's in French, she finally listened and let me transfer her to a French rep.~~I work tech support for a Japanese company. The department I work in has 4 people, all American. Why that's important will be clear in a moment. I took a call from a gentleman. He had a very thick accent, but I've gotten good at deciphering most accents, so I powered through. He wants to know why his TV won't pick up all his antenna channels. He said that he was getting a few channels but not all of them. He ran a channel scan a few times, no luck. Normally the solution is to check on the antenna. If something was wrong with the TV, you wouldn't be able to pick up any stations. The fact that he was able to get a few but not all points to a problem with the antenna. I told him once again to check the antenna because the issue doesn't point to something wrong with the TV. He says fine and hangs up. Few hours later, I get another call. It's the same guy. This time he asks to speak to someone in Japanese. I put him on hold and call our translator line and conference a translator in.~~A woman called tech support because her new radio was in Spanish.

She also told me that America is going to turn into Mexico in 10 years, and that the Amish are a cult. She also warned me to keep an eye on AOC, because she is trying to turn us into Saudi Arabia. And finally, she told me that Bernie Sanders is a Russian spy, and that I should google him.~~A few weeks ago, I posted an article called ""Don't Call Me Honey"" that discussed the use of the term ""honey"" in a derogatory manner. The post received a lot of attention, mostly from people who agreed with the message. However, some people did not like the post, and some even went as far as to say that the post was racist. Well, I have news for those people: racism has nothing to do with this post. The post is about respect. It is about being polite and using proper manners.~~Today I had a customer on the phone who asked for somebody and I said that they weren't available as they were on another call, and could I put them through to voicemail. He responded snarkily - ""no, voicemail isn't going to work for my needs right now"". (uhhh, ok.... sorry to trouble you with that request, your majesty.~~I work for a retail call center (no cold calling, customers call us, we are also pretty nice about taking the customer's word for mishaps and trying to make things right when something goes wrong). I want to begin this by saying that I have both close friends and family that live in currently and/or are originally from various northern states (including ny, which is a place I love--both the city and the upstate areas). So, just clarifying that I understand the basic attitudes and am not offended by them (I'm not offended easily in general, actually). I also know that what I have experienced does not apply to everyone, so I am not trying to say this applies to all people from these regions or anything like that.~~Insurance agent calls customer to take a statement about car accident. The customer was heading to the beach with friends and family. The customer rented a car for 3 days to go on vacation with his girlfriend. His mother in law is sick, so they decided to go on vacation nearby. The customer will get back to the insurance agent with the information about the people who were waiting for him at the beach.~~So I work for a call center that supports tech. I got a call today which a guy needed help and he mentioned something on our site about Black Lives Matter, something totally unrelated to the call. For background, I'm a white woman with biracial children. When the George Floyd video was posted on TikTok, my 8-year-old daughter asked if our family was going to be broken up. It broke my heart. So back to the call, I finish up business and the man mentions something about inequality and how our CEO has so much money he can probably buy yachts. I say yeah hopefully with all the craziness going on some changes will be made for inequality. Wrong thing for me to say.. The man starts going off and saying how the media is portraying this to be more than what it is and then says something like yeah the only black guys killed in 2019 were doing something violent or all head weapons. I lost it! It took everything to not snap on this man. My voice started cracking and I say ok sir now that we concluded business, bye bye. That's when he knew he messed up.~~I'm an agent in the healthcare field. I get a call and the whisper before the patient is connected says a russian interpreter is needed. i put the customer in good and get one on the line. 

once the interpreter is in the line the patient goes into this long winded story in russian. i don't speak russian but she sounded pretty upset. she was wanting to know if we'd received her referral for a particular clinic that required one. 

after looking her up i was able to confirm that no, we haven't received it yet. then she goes into another long winded upset sounding speech in russian. the interpreter kept trying to get her attention but she just kept going for like 5 minutes. in the end, the interpreter tells me she has no idea what this lady said and she's not making any sense. 

i take a look at the notes that offer some clarification that she's wanting to be scheduled but we still don't have a referral but she had said that one was sent. i told her i'd have the clinic call her to see if maybe we had received it but it wasn't in the system yet or something.~~I work for a company that's contracted out by others to handle temporary increases in call center load. they are so bad they had to change their name because their reputation is terrible.  one of the things we have drilled into us is we must speak english.  if you speak another language and your customer speaks that language too, you either both speak english or you lose that sale.  so even though we represent an american company, and we get customers calling in asking for spanish speakers, we are not allowed to forward them to anyone on staff who can speak spanish because the qa people reviewing the calls don't.~~A racist white woman called ICE on a Mexican man who was working in front of her. The man was polite and did not cuss her out. She was screaming and offering more information each time she repeated herself. She was mad that there was a Mexican man working in front. She was preparing to sue the company for our offense, race traitor behavior. She wanted to let my American company be ashamed of themselves for hiring non whites.~~I work in customer service. When people call and choose the option for speaking to someone who speaks English, my screen shows that they want to speak English. I answer the phone in English. Half the time, the person on the other end asks if I speak English.~~I work in a call center. It's not my dream job or anything, but it's fine. I've been working there for a few months and I've gotten along with my co-workers and my boss. I handle complaints and I rarely get complaints about my English. In fact, most people I talk to don't even realize I have an accent. Today, however, I had a very difficult customer. She was angry about something (I don't even remember what it was now) and she kept using the word ""you"" in every sentence. I asked her to repeat herself several times, but she refused. She just kept saying ""you don't understand"" and ""no you do not understand ma'am"". I eventually got a manager to take the call. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to handle a call like that again.~~I work in a call center. We get calls from all over the place. Today I had a guy call in and want to get service and too bad for him he is outside our service area by about 2 miles. I informed him of this and he started screaming at me and said it is because trump wants to deport my kind and that is why i won't give him service and hung up in a rage. Next call I wish I was joking, another person looking for service and they too were outside our grid and started going off me saying i was racist and hate foreigners which is why we refuse to service him and hangs up. I can never win.~~I work in a call center. We can not ask the customer if they need an interpreter. The customer needs to express the need for one or speak English to us. Normally this is not a problem. A lot of second language folks ask for an interpreter right off the bat. But there are times when they go into full blown conversation and I lose them. I know for a fact it is frustrating you having to repeat yourself. So please, if you can not hold good conversational English ask for an interpreter. Because it's better than me saying I don't understand or you saying huh.~~I was born and raised mostly in Texas. My dad was active duty Air Force growing up and while born in Texas, I actually learned to speak while we were stationed in England. We moved back to Texas after living all over the United States in time for me to start Jr. High. I still live in Texas. Oddly enough, I didn't realize I even had an accent until I was in my early 20s.~~Hi everyone! I work at tech support for a major CCTV company. I speak Spanish and English. I used to take both types of calls. Now I just take a special English line (like 3 calls per day). Before I answer the phone, I have a whisper to identify which call is which. It could either say Spanish or English. I get annoyed when an English speaking customer calls the Spanish line. I have to connect them to the English queue.

8.0,"So I'm an American working for an American company that does credit card escalations. One of my least favorite call types I get are the ""I want someone in the US"". They are almost always some crazy, entitled racist moron. I also hate how they come across like, ""I just want to keep jobs in the US!"" like I'm supposed to get down on my knees and kiss their ass for being so generous as to single handedly keeping me employed while also keeping the economy going.... You're not a hero, Karen, you're a racist and an idiot.~~I just a read a post that reminded me of this call i got once.   old lady on a hospice account was calling because she was a hospice patient and she didn't feel right.  she sounded confused and uneasy the whole time and when i asked for her phone number she fumbled around saying she didn't know.   then she goes ""oh wait a minute..."" and proceeds to recite a working phone number in spanish.  something like ""uno quatro cinco - bente sies ocho"".~~A white man called the cops on a black man who was trying to enter his apartment building. The black man was a friend of the white man's son. The white man told the cops that the black man had a gun. The cops came, found nothing, and left. The black man lives in the building and had a key.~~I work in a call center. I've been working there for 8 years and have had many interesting calls. Most of the time I can handle myself and not let these calls get to me. But lately I've been having issues with a few clients. They are rude, insulting, and just down right mean. I've never had issues with clients before. But lately it's been non stop with a few clients. How do I handle this without losing my job? I can't just walk away from my job. But I don't want to deal with these people anymore.~~I answered a call in English because it was tagged in English. The guy just says ""I'm just waiting for someone in Spanish"". I'm like: ""Do you speak Spanish? I'm speaking to you in Spanish"". Then he says there's no problem and hangs up. I hate when people do that.~~I work at a call center in north dakota. I'm not sure if it's the location (not originally from this state) or just how people are, but I find that I have a lot of racist coworkers!~~I worked in a call center in Mexico. We had a problem with one of our clients. She was mad about something and she was swearing at me. I tried to help her but she didn't want it. She was really angry and she was insulting me. I will tell you some other stories later.~~I work in a call center. Our call center has several call centers in foreign countries and so there's a lot of ""oh, thank god, someone who speaks english!"" (1) all of our reps speak english, even in foreign countries and (2) this is almost always a prelude to a short ""i'm not racist but-"" speech from the customer. I don't want to sound like I'm joining them in their cozy little blanketfort of mild racism (we get points counted off for that) but I also don't want to simply ignore it (we also get points counted off for that, as we are to 'connect and empathize' with the customer.). What I've been saying in response is ""well, I'm glad you have me on the line. What can I help you with?"" but that sometimes kicks off yet another racist rant in the guise of ""thanking me"" for being an American.~~Hi, I'm a Spanish-English interpreter. I work from home. I have a laptop and a good headset for me to get your calls and try my best to help you. I should mention I worked at a regular customer service call center before, so I have experience on your side of the coin. Everybody is so friendly. Clients (you reps) and your customers are very respectful towards us, me anyway, but sometimes there are things you may do, which are actually quite understandable, but that make both of our jobs much harder.~~So I work in a call center. I answer the phone, ""Hello, thank you for calling XYZ, how may I help you today?"" And then she immediately asks for a supervisor. I ask her why and she says, ""I want to speak to someone who speaks a little better English."" I'm English. I was born English. I've spoken English my whole life. It doesn't matter where I am, I'm English. So I argue with her about it and then she hangs up on me.~~I don't know what it is with some of these overseas reps. More than half the time I have to deal with them it just ends up being an overall frustrating experience both calling as a representative and as a customer. I have to repeat things 4 or 5 times just for them to still misunderstand the question. I understand there may be a bit of a language barrier but if that's the case why are they working in a call center for customers that for the most part speak primarily English? It's like they are being set up for constant abuse. I used to work for a bank and our fraud department was based in the Philippines. I would often get a debit card fraud agent who insists that I can resolve the fraudulent charge myself. If that were true what would we need a debit card fraud department for?~~I work in a call center. I handle the English and Spanish queue. There is this one Spanish call I get every day, and every day they ask me if they can speak to someone in Spanish. I mean, really? Are you really just waiting for a chance to speak so much that you can't even tell what language I'm speaking? I don't know if they can tell I'm annoyed by the tone when I say ""I am speaking Spanish to you.~~I work in a call centre where we are obliged to speak our mothertongue. I don't want to identify my callcentre, so let's say my native tongue is polish and I work on the border near Russia. Most of us speak a little Russian, but the company does not put it in the job description since, technically, we're not allowed to speak another language than Polish on the phone. However, in a few of the towns that we bill to, Russian-speaking people live. Sometimes they call in and ask to speak Russian and I happily oblige, however rusty my Russian may be.

about a six months into my career as a call center agent, i started to have a real appreciation for people who took spanish in college.  i had years of semi-forgotten french under my belt, and had never once been able to help a foreign customer muddle through their claim.  imagine my delight after months of working calls from texas and having to explain that while yes, i did have a hispanic last name (through marriage), no habla espanol, i finally got a call from a french speaking woman.  

me: (still in english because she was doing pretty well) i'd be happy to review your loss, ma'am, it'll be just one moment!~~Me: Blah blah blah, bonjour! *I can hear background noise, but the caller isn't responding. Not uncommon, people often think I'm the automated system talking still*. Caller: Uh...i don't speak french, can you transfer me to the english line? Me: Oh!

After assuring her that the fridge will not explode, she asks where she should keep the onion.~~A new report released today reveals the best and worst states for customer service. The report, which was conducted by 24/7 Wall St., relied on data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) to compare customer service in all 50 states. According to the ACSI, customer satisfaction with the quality of products and services purchased in the United States fell 2.7% to a score of 76.9 (on a 100-point scale) in 2015. 24/7 Wall St. also considered data on median household income, poverty rates, and educational attainment rates in each state. According to the report: ""The 10 states with the worst customer service are mostly in the South and the West. The 10 states with the best customer service are mostly in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest.~~hi! i've been working for a call center for about a month and we recently started taking real calls, both in english and spanish. and it makes me chuckle the way hispanic people explain their problems as how americans/other english speakers explain theirs. like this mexican lady. she call on my --i believe-- third day and i open with my script in english: ""thank you for calling [company]. this is [name], how may i help you?"", she the asked if i spoke spanish, i told her i did and she then went into this long rant/story about her ex-husband: that he was a manipulative, demanding, overbearing liar. that he once appear at her door with a baseball bat. that he kept threatening her with taking away the account she had with us. that he kept stalking her, her phone and everything she did with it. my god, poor woman.~~I work in a call centre. I am not located in North America. I have a very strong accent. I understand that most people do not like calling offshore call centres. But I find it interesting that most of the people that I talk to think that I am in the Philippines. Or that I am some sort of Indian (I am not Indian, but I do have a very strong accent, so I can see why they would think that). But it is interesting that they think that all offshore call centres are in the Philippines or India.~~A member of the BNP has been reported to the police after making a series of racist and offensive calls to a Scottish call centre.

8.0,"I work for as a producer for an insurance company with 24/7 bilingual producers in addition to the normal english-only reps. the only language we support in-house is spanish, for other languages we have to call a third-party contracted translator service to translate back and forth. it's a real nightmare because it makes calls so long, but it the worst is when someone clearly needs a translator and doesn't ask for one. i'm not allowed to offer it unless they in some way mention that they have difficulty understanding me due to the language barrier, i assume it's to avoid coming off as trying to insult their english skills but i really think that's a dumb rule and it's strictly better for both parties to have direct translation.~~Receptionists are made to be nice on the outside.

Now I don't know if this is the same in all call centers but whenever I get the prompt that the call is from a translation service I feel like hanging up. Here's why: Firstly, when answering a call we all give the company introduction and most customers by the large majority, even the brain dead Karens let us finish it. No they talk through it. Secondly, in a lot of cases the customer speaks very little English and the interpreter will speak half to them and half to me. All the while I can hear both people and the customer will say somethings in English that seems to be to me and sometimes the interpreter will say things to the customer but then again it could be me. Then it will be half English, half the customers language. Also to add a lot of the interpreters come from the country they are interpreting for; no surprise there and thus often have very strong accents making it even harder to know if the interpreter is talking or the customer. So is the customer speaking to me directly, to the interpreter or both?~~I work in customer support and I love the variety of accents that I get to hear on a daily basis. My favourite was a call from Canada with a Newfoundland accent. The guy sounded Irish, and I had never heard of that accent so I'm sitting there going ""Why am I getting a call from a random Irish guy on the Canada line?"". He even called me sweetheart and darling. The majority of my callers are from the USA.

I really want to quit so I can focus on my certifications and getting a better job in some kind of IT department. I need the money just to stay afloat. This job is literally making me lose faith in humanity and I just don't know what to do anymore.~~I work in a seafood and deli department of a grocery store. It's a terrible job. The pay is terrible, the benefits are nonexistent, and the hours are ridiculous. I am being offered a job in a call center. It's a nine-to-five job with great benefits and pay. What is it like working in a call center?~~I just started a new job at a call center. I have a background in warehouse and general labor. I did not think I would get the job, let alone an invite for an interview. So far I enjoy working inside, not opening boxes, stocking shelves, etc. Something about having a work station, office chair, and working inside when the weather is complete crap outside is a beautiful feeling. I am not even started with the company perks. However, I do not like the occasional cuss out or smart mouth customer.~~A company I worked for had a big quality improvement program.  Someone in management allegedly with a college degree decided it would be a good idea to institute a quality improvement program.  Using current metrics, any agent whose scores for the month were below average was let go.  Never mind if they were meeting past expectations.  The new expectation was better than average.~~I worked from home doing phone support for an online retailer for the past two years. It was okay, but the daily grind of back-to-back calls, rude customers, impossible metrics, and sitting on my ass all day was taking it's toll. I also worked until 8pm so I missed out on a lot of after work things I wanted to do. What really motivated me to look for a new job was remembering how bad the holidays were last year. Frequently the queue was 1,500 people deep, and each caller was angrier than the last, and it lasted for almost 2 months.~~I've been working a job that I took during the pandemic. It was only supposed to be temporary, but after a year it's become apparent that it's not going anywhere. I've been working 10 hour shifts, often dealing with people who are angry and frustrated. There's been a lot of verbal abuse. I snapped on a call a month ago. I hung up on someone who was screaming at me. I foolishly told my supervisor. Now, I'm not eligible for any promotions for 6 months. I've been having a few promising interviews and am planning how I'll spend my remaining days of paid time off after I receive an offer.~~Hi all, I was recently promoted to a business trainer role. It's a half on half off position. 50% the new role and 50% on my team under my normal manager. I feel under an enormous amount of pressure to be perfect while on the phones. It places me in a really awkward limbo position and naturally my regular manager will use this against me every time I make a mistake. Has anyone else been through a similar process? How did you handle it?~~A former employee of a Sydney call centre has described the centre's working conditions as ""soul-destroying"". The employee, who worked in the centre for several months, said the job became too much as they kept getting more responsibilities, more calls, yet no increase in pay. They also used to have paid breaks but the centre got rid of them. ""It got to the point where I would feel super anxious before every shift and just end up feeling miserable with callers yelling at me, berating me, and being super rude. I had enough and wrote my resignation today,"" the former employee said.~~I work in a call center. It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but it's not bad either. I'm not on the phones taking sh*t from angry customers all day, and I actually really like my job. I've even been told that I'm really good at it. So I got a raise today. Not a huge one, but definitely noticeable. And it's not even Christmas yet.~~I've been in this call center for a little over a year and I've hated every minute of it. My anxiety levels have spiked and I come home every night feeling on edge and irrationally angry. I've been applying to countless jobs since I graduated college two years ago, but all I can get interviews for are really scammy sales jobs or other call center jobs. Well, yesterday I was accepted into a master's program in information technology and today I was offered an assistantship that will pay my tuition so now I can go to school virtually debt free! It feels amazing to have an end date at this hell hole in sight. No more metrics, no more queues, and no more customers! In just a few weeks, I'll be in school doing what I love.~~I worked in a call center for a utility company for three years. It paid well but I was constantly stressed. I have a degree in accounting but couldn't move up. I started looking for other jobs in June. I went on two hour lunch breaks for interviews. I got a job offer last Friday in my field. I gave my notice yesterday. I have so much energy I didn't know what to do with myself. It's actually quite amazing.~~A former boss got mad at his employee. The employee quit and sent the boss a letter. The boss got mad. The employee won.~~I work in a call center.  The turnover rate is insane.  I've been there for 3 years and I recognize very few faces.  Most people don't last more than 4 months.  The hours are long and the work is extremely repetitive.  I can see how someone could lose their mind working here.  There is very little variation in the work flow.  You take calls, or you work on tickets.  That's it.  Every day, all day.  And the customers are, for the most part, extremely rude and unappreciative.  I don't know a single person who enjoys working in a call center.~~Racism is still an issue in the workplace. Have you ever witnessed or experienced racism at work? How did you respond? Share your story with us.~~I just got a new job! After almost 4 years in various call centers, I'm moving on to a new adventure. I'm still in the same industry, but now I'll be a QA Auditor of the files. A role which I feel plays directly to my best strengths and experience in my current position. I could not be more excited for the opportunity and new challenges ahead.~~I've been coming to this sub every day for the last year. the anecdotes helped me realize that this job isn't all bad. last year I started as a phone rep and got promoted quickly through the ranks, tier two, supervisor, then supervisor lead. one of my coworkers noticed my programming skill in automating much of our backend work and gave my name to someone. after a call, an interview, and a brief contract period I finally start a new job as a computer programmer with no degree. thank you to everyone on this sub for your advice as I moved through the ranks. keep doing what your doing and never let the customers get to you. you're all awesome.","In which new management fires everyone~~I FINALLY GOT A NEW JOB!~~In finally free :)~~""You need to break the rules to show leadership.

I've worked in a call center for 6 years. But it's a job, you know? But the problem is, I'm really good at my job. Like, I'm the best at my job. But I'm leaving anyway.

9.0,"Ever worked in a call centre? If so, you'll know the pain of having to follow a script word-for-word, every time you speak to a customer. It doesn't matter if you're having a bad day, or the customer is being unreasonable – you have to stay polite and professional, or risk losing your job. It's exhausting. Thankfully, someone has created a game that perfectly recreates the experience. You can try it here.~~A poster on Reddit gave an interesting insight into working for a debt collection agency in the UK. The user explained that their previous job involved working in a call centre for an outsourcing company. They described the working conditions as ""bullshit"" with a ""5 minute call time"". The new role is for a major collections agency in Glasgow. The poster explained that the training is one-on-one and there is no electronic scheduling system. Staff get free fruit and there is a real sense of warmth in the office. The role involves working with customers to find affordable solutions to their debt.~~I've been working at a call center for a little over a year now. It's not the worst job I've had but it's definitely not the best. I'm paid well and have great benefits. The problem is, I can't stand the work. It's so monotonous and I feel like a robot. I've been thinking about quitting but I'm not sure if it's the right decision.~~I've been working in a call center for a little over two years. I started out in technical support, answering calls about our products and services. About a year ago I moved into a role that was more focused on the sales side of things. I'm pretty good at my job and I get along well with my coworkers. The problem is, I'm stuck. I can't seem to get promoted. I've applied for several different positions within the company, but I keep getting rejected. I'm starting to think that I need to leave this job and find something else.~~I was passed over for a promotion a few weeks ago. I take escalated calls, offer support for the warehouse, take general calls, as well as administrative tasks for employees. My average handle time and after call work was over 2 seconds higher than the average requirement. The person who got the promotion is someone who's mistakes I've corrected a number of times, is only tier 2, and has only been here half the time I have. I'm so sick of going above and beyond for customers only to get screwed by my company for it. I want to leave so bad... has anyone else had a similar experience?~~Employee turnover is a significant issue in the call center industry. Turnover rates are typically higher in call centers than in other industries. This can have a negative impact on employee morale and performance. The industry uses a variety of methods to combat the issue of employee turnover, including employee recognition programs, incentive pay, and career development opportunities.~~I work in a call center. My job is to provide excellent customer service and address all concerns to the best of my ability. I actually do a good job at this. However, my supervisors micromanage the hell out of me. I can't take a piss without my supervisor listening to the call. It's ridiculous. Why do call centers treat people this way?~~I feel like I always hear people on work subreddits talking about how your biggest pay raise happens when you change jobs. From what I've been seeing, there are a lot of job postings with similar requirements for much more pay and I'm just not sure. I'm a call center rep and I make $13.50 an hour. There are a lot of job postings for $15-16/hr. Will I really get a pay bump if I change jobs? I'm just not sure.~~Customer Service Appreciation Week is a thing that happens at some companies, and it's exactly what it sounds like. We have a different theme for each day, and today's theme is ""Hat Day."" I work in a call center, and I have to wear a hat all day, even though I'm not allowed to actually talk to customers while I'm wearing it. It's a very silly rule that I don't understand, but I'm not going to argue because IT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE APPRECIATION WEEK, DAMMIT.~~I've been working in a call center for almost a year (going to be a year in july when my contract renews). I've always had good results, good attendance and punctuality. I was even mentoring some of the new employees. Yesterday, I got a message from my manager to call him. He told me they weren't going to renew my contract. Makes no sense, because I had great results, was always on time, and had a good relationship with my boss. I'm happy I'm leaving, because I didn't like the job, but it's still frustrating.~~This story was written by Dalton B. and originally posted on Reddit. It has been republished here with permission. Dalton works for a company that does outbound calling for colleges and universities to request donations for annual funds as well as reaching out to prospective students with surveys to peak interest for up coming fall semesters. This week he was calling surveys for a school, and part of the job is to reach out to the parents to complete the survey if the student is unavailable. The call was an experience he has not encountered in over six years of calling.~~I worked in a call center for a little over a year. It was a job I fell into after I had my son, because it was the only thing I could find that was flexible enough for me to be a single mom and work. It was a decent paying job, and the people I worked with were great. But after a year of working there I started having anxiety attacks. I would get these awful feelings of dread and fear that something bad was going to happen. I would shake, my heart would race, I would feel like I couldn't breathe. I would have to leave work and go home and take a nap. I went to the doctor and she said I had mild postpartum depression and anxiety. She gave me some meds and I started feeling better. But I couldn't shake this feeling that I was not cut out to work in a call center. I would dread going to work every day. I would cry on my way to work. I would cry at work. I would cry on my way home. I would cry in the shower. I would cry while making dinner. I would cry while putting my son to bed. I would cry while watching tv. I would cry all the time.~~I'm so tired. I've been working in call centers since I graduated college. I started at big companies, thinking I could move up, but was actively sabotaged by higher-ups in my efforts to advance. I've since taken a $2/hour pay cut to work for a nonprofit healthcare office. I'm still doing call center work, but I'm also functioning as a trainer/assistant manager. I'm at wit's end. I don't want to work in a call center anymore, but I have no idea how to get out.~~I was a call center rep/in customer service for almost 2 years. It was a high volume, stressful position. I was promoted to a new specialist position. I went from taking many calls and answering customer e-mails all day to now sorting, managing and updating many spreadsheets all day. I actually enjoy numbers so that part of the job is ideal for me. I also have new flexibility. I can take my breaks when I want, have my lunch when I want. I have a normal schedule now (no more waking up for 6 a.m. shift on a consistent basis).~~so i have decided to document my experiences from working in call centers into an ongoing series. 

just a little bit of background. while i no longer work in a call center, i have years of experience from working as an entry level agent up to management, and then finally training. i worked for a major outsourcing company that handled many major, multinational accounts. most of my experience, however, is from the satellite television industry. with a little bit of cable provider mixed in.~~I've been in my job for almost a year and a half now, and I'm just ready to be done with it. I want to move on to a preferably behind-the-scenes position with little or no customer contact. I'm trying to decide what field I specifically want to be in, but I'm lucky to have low-risk chances like volunteering and talking to other people in the fields of my choice to figure that out. I'm also planning to build new skills through online classes. I was originally a communications major, graduated in 2008, and a lot has changed in my field since then.~~A recent job ad posted by Amazon.com for a call centre worker has sparked a debate over whether the company is exploiting vulnerable people. The ad specifically targets people who have experience of mental health, behavioural health or direct support. Amazon was also recently accused of exploiting workers in a warehouse in Germany. The company has faced similar accusations in the past, regarding workers in sweatshop-like conditions in China.~~I work in a call center. It's high stress, high turnover, and I'm finally cracking under the pressure. I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. What are some good, high paying jobs that don't require a degree? I'm willing to go back to school if necessary, but would prefer to avoid it. I have a liberal arts degree and have been working in this call center for 2 and a half years.~~I worked at a call center for a little over a month. I hated it. The people were nice and the pay was good, but I just couldn't take the monotony. I'm really glad I quit when I did because I don't think I could have lasted much longer.~~I recently had a job interview for a call center position. I got a call back yesterday saying that my references basically sunk my chances at the job. I'm not sure how to approach this. I've talked to my manager about this and she is just as puzzled. Any advice would be appreciated.~~I've been hired as a call center supervisor. I've never worked in a call center, and I've never managed more than 6-8 people at once. I'm sure I have the experience and intelligence to manage, but I'm concerned I may not be able to jump right in. What should I be doing and learning? What could I do to make your lives as easy as possible?~~Hi redditors, I've been working in the call centre industry for a few years now and I don't mind it, but at the same time, I really want to leave and try something else.

9.0,"I've spent eight years in call centers in one capacity or another (representative and supervisor for about 4 years each -- trust me, not any less stressful being a supervisor, you've still got someone up your ass 8 hours a day, but you're also salary so you take it home with you too). I recently took vacation and realized 1) I am unhappy and 2) that I've pigeon-holed myself into this type of work. I originally started at a call center when the job market was not great back in 2012 or so, and one thing led to another and that's what I'm still doing. Just curious for those former call center employees out there, what are you doing now? I'm seriously looking into a career change and I don't want to fall into something else that makes me unhappy.~~I made a huge change at the start of this year. I moved away from the state I was born in 21 years ago. I left during my last year (and a half maybe?) of university because a friend said that he could offer me a good opportunity. I now work in a call center. It's not a sales call center. I work for a company that provides PCI compliance, which is essentially rules and guidelines that any business that is taking card payments ""must follow"". They get charged if they don't.~~I started a new remote customer service job last week. I was excited because it was full time and paid well. I quickly found out that the company does sales/customer service for 20 other companies as well. We help people place orders for products and provide customer service for their orders. They use a very outdated dos system for order entry along with another program you have to fill out the customer info and call notes on at the same time. Many times I'm not finished inputting the information they want before the customer disconnects and the next call comes in the queue. It gives 5 seconds between calls. I've spent my breaks trying to catch up so I don't get in trouble for taking my status off calls. Being remote I can only call a supervisor for help on difficult calls but sometimes they're busy helping other reps or no one is available. Customers on the phone get very upset because I can't help them and I can't get ahold of someone to help them. I waited for one for 16 min today and no one ever answered because it was after 5 on a Friday and I don't think many people work that late. I also haven't been adjusting well to sitting for long periods.~~I work in a small call center of about 40 employees. We are the customer service department of a start-up company. I like my job because I like talking to new people every day. I don't mind if someone is angry because it's usually something they did wrong. Our only big metric is abandonment rate. We also have a fully stocked break room with snacks, drinks, and a barrista making espresso drinks.~~I took a job that saved my company and 400 jobs. It was a great opportunity and I was able to work with sales in my current role and save the jobs. The deal was I needed to stay so I turned down the opportunity. My passion was more the new job, but I care about my team. We are doing better than ever, but the reality is operating in this area will become uneconomical by the end of 2017. In the world we are in, you can simply do it cheaper somewhere else. The opportunity has came up again and I have accepted.~~A lot of people think that all you need to work in a call center is to speak English. That's a big lie. You need to learn the booking process for hotels and flights, the policy, and you need to be able to listen to every detail, even if the call has a bad connection. The questions they ask in the interviews are not easy either.~~I worked for a call center for a year and a half. It was a good job while it lasted, but recently the company I worked for lost a major contract and had to let over 100 people go. Including me. I'm wondering if I should look for another call center job or if I should try something new. I don't want to go back to a job that I just left, but I'm not sure what to do. Any advice?~~I've been working in a call center for 4 years. I graduated college a year before I got the job. I'm going back to school to get an IT certificate. I've always been interested in computers. I started building PCs and learning about managing servers after getting into Minecraft. I got an A+ back in February. It's served as a foundation for further study.~~I was recently laid off from my job. I was working in a call center. I was hired two years ago as a customer service representative. About a year ago I was promoted to the real-time traffic/workforce team. This was the best position I have ever had. The phones had me at my breaking point, but the pay was great and the hours were good. I am just at a loss as to what to do now. I am applying for some other local companies, but I would still have to start at the agent level and I can't even think of any other job field my experience would transfer too.~~So I was wondering if we could share our success stories after leaving the call center. Or if your still in the call center where are you applying and what skills in your current position led you to apply there? I currently work in an insurance call center and have gained a lot of industry knowledge plus experience working with distraught customers. I am applying for claims examiner / underwriting positions at midsize insurers.~~i have been working in a contact center for over 5 years now.  i have busted my hump, and i truly do love the work i do and im passionate about the brand i represent.  i recently decided that all of my behind the scenes level 3 type support could lend itself well to becoming a supervisor.  so i successfully got the job, and this week was my first week. 

contrary to the title, im really excited and ive been enjoying it.  in five years, ive developed good relationships with a lot of the team.  it helped that i was a leader but not their direct supervisor.  i was hopeful that i could keep up that momentum as someone who is well liked and trusted.~~2 weeks ago i flew out for my final interview.  the actual final interviews took from about 11 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon.  i was in the zone.  i stuffed back my fears and came out like a pro.  flew back home the next day. wednesday of this week i got a call.  recruiter tells me ""first i want you to hear me out.  the manager and i discussed the interviews and with everything you'd need to learn to be able to handle this year's peak season, it's just too much.  we had to say no.  we were very very impressed with your interview though.  you are a real talent and we couldn't afford to let you slip through our fingers.  some (slightly lower) salary positions came open very recently.  we want to offer you one of those.  we will get you caught up and then we'll see about getting you that big position.~~I've been at my call center for a year now so I'm eligible to apply for higher positions. I've been pretty vocal about wanting to move up and have tried very hard to get off the phone. My supervisors and managers encouraged me to apply for a supervisor position and said I'd be a great candidate. Well, now all hiring is done through an automated HR system and my resume was disqualified. I have a bachelor's degree, which is more than most people at my center have. There's nothing anyone can do and I feel lied to, cheated, and frustrated beyond belief. I really would like to quit but I have literally nothing to fall back on. It's time to look for a job elsewhere.~~I worked at a call center for a year. I hated it, but it was a means to an end. I needed money and this was the only place that would hire me. I had left university, and was working on certs, so I wasn't your typical call center employee. Most of the people I worked with were either uninterested in learning or just plain stupid. There were a few that were actually pretty smart, but they all left. The ones that stayed were either uninterested or just didn't care.~~I work in a call center. It's a job I fell into after getting laid off from my last job. I was hired on a temporary basis, which has since become permanent. I've been looking for other jobs, but haven't had any luck. I recently applied for a job at a competitor's store. I went in for an interview and was offered the job on the spot. I accepted the job without telling my current employer. When I told my team leader I was leaving, he asked me what I was thinking and then took me to the operations manager's office. The operations manager and my team leader told me that I was up for a fast-track promotion and they wanted me to start coaching other agents. I also have amazing health benefits. And it was a sales position, where my hours depended on my performance and no health benefits.~~I gave my two weeks notice at my job yesterday. It was a really hard decision because I make good money and have great benefits. However, I've been feeling extremely unhappy and unfulfilled for the last several months and I knew that I needed to make a change. I'm really excited about my new job, but also terrified about the uncertainty of not having a regular paycheck.

I went to the interview and remember a little room crowded with people doing the online test. They immediately hired me and sent me off to do the drug test. I was so proud of myself.

Could you please share some tips, tricks and things I should (or not) say, some general advice on how to fake that I'm the perfect candidate for the role of team leader in the interview?~~I had my final technical interview yesterday.  I probably won't know anything until next week.  I'm on pins and needles and am dying to know if I get the job or not.  I'm not a person to get panic attacks.  I generally remain calm and cool.  But I've had a couple mild panic attacks during this process.  There is so much at stake.  They say that people don't get many opportunities for the big break in life.  Some don't even get one.  This is my shot and I know it.  I cannot afford to fail here.~~I work in a call center. I'm approaching a year in this job. I have 10+ years of office admin/management and customer service experience and was under the impression that this job would be more customer service based rather than selling. It has been a huge adjustment. I have spoken with my supervisor about my ""future"" with the company and the fact that I appreciate my employment but will not be able to continue to do it forever. Of course, I was told that they understood and maybe ""soon"", once the company ""expanded more"", there would be positions for team leaders etc. I have both experience and education and feel like I am being underutilized in my position. Don't get me wrong...I'm not bragging. I just know my capabilities and have proven myself (and been recognized for it). I have exceeded all metrics and have a good relationship with my coworkers and supervisors.~~After graduating from college, I didn't know what to do. I had a liberal arts degree and was looking for a job, any job. My university had a job fair. I submitted my resume to a temp agency. Two months later they contacted me with an interview for an ISP. After six interviews, I got a tech support job. It sucked, but the company treated me very well. I worked my ass off and was promoted to being an office admin. Now I'm interviewing for field tech jobs.~~I've been working as a CSR for a paratransit service for almost 3 years now, and I want out. I enjoy working for the local bus company, but I hate being on the phones. We've also been getting word from higher up that they might make us all temps again just after hiring us on full-time last December. I'm just not sure where I can go from here. I'm legally blind, so I feel like nobody is going to hire me. I've had plenty of interviews in the past before getting this job--that I got out of sheer luck--but they were all with insurance sales pyramid schemes. I don't have marketable skills. I have a degree in Spanish, so nothing special, and I'm very introverted, so networking is nigh impossible.~~I work for a very large company that has an internal call center for employees. It's a very stressful job and the pay is not that great. There is a lot of favoritism and politics. I was hired because I am bilingual. Most of the other agents are not. There is a QA department that listens to random recorded calls and grades the agents. I got a 52 on my first QA. I have been doing everything correctly, I made 90 and above at my old job. I am just wondering if I should start looking for another job.~~I recently joined this sub as I've just accepted a part-time call centre role in student services at a local university. From my understanding, it's primarily helping current and prospective students with enrolment/eligibility questions and providing information on course etc etc. All inbound, no cold calling. I have a friend who did a similar role at a different university and she said it wasn't bad, but some of the posts on here have freaked me out. I'll be doing it part-time as I'm doing my postgrad at the same time but it'll be completely new territory for me as I've never worked in a role like this before. Any advice you'd offer a first-timer?~~I've been working in a call center for 9 1/2 years as technical support for an ISP. I've liked my job for the most part, and I've had quite a few roles over the years. TSR, mentor, lead TSR, outbound survey, and sub-supervisor. I've treated each call like a puzzle, working to solve each issue, and look to the next one. Lately, the puzzles have become stagnant, and repetitive. So, I went back to school. I majored in Network Administration and Design. I learned everything I could to prepare myself for a Network Operations Center position and beyond. Finally, a few months ago, I interviewed for NOC. It didn't go well. So, with the help of a friend, I polished up the old resume, and started applying to jobs around the area. Last week, I interviewed for a Field Service IT Specialist position for a security monitoring company. It went well. I was offered the job today. I start on July 11th.~~I work for a large bank in the credit card department. I got hired on in Nov. My team manager actually liked me so much that he said I should go for a promotion that opened up about a month ago. I went ahead and applied, and I got the promotion. But, ultimately, I hate this job. Even the good days are bad. The calls are back-to-back, all day every day. Average between 100-120 calls a day. There was recently a pretty serious threat made to the building (you may have seen the post) that the bank really didn't take very seriously.~~Hi everyone. I'm a newbie here. I started a new job today at a call center. I'm not sure if I'm going to like it but I need the money. The pay is base pay plus commission. I'm not sure if I can last more than a month in this job. I've been reading some of the other posts and it doesn't sound like a fun job. But I'll give it a shot.~~I was hired at a call center today. I'm pretty sure it's not going to be a long-term thing, but I needed the money for student loan debt. I'll be working part time, two dollars over minimum wage. I have two days off a week, but one of them is a weekend day. The dress code is relaxed, business casual. I don't have to ask for money, but the highest level of call you can work up to is setting up appointments.~~I have over 10 years in the call center industry. I have a promotion running innovation for 40 centers, and my drive was what it was on the phones. How do I make the job suck less? So I have a few comments, feel free to ask questions or lob insults of your own. There is something I have noticed I would say over the last 3 years. First, industry absenteeism going up domestically significantly and the propensity for call center executives to blame it on millennials in the workplace. That this is the new normal. I do not think this is true, and if it is it is because organizationally we are missing the mark somewhere. What do you think?~~I was just offered a job at a call center selling scholarship fund donations to alumni at a major US university. I'm wondering if most people like this kind of job. My dad did it when he was in college and he said it was extremely easy. It seems like a pretty good gig, there are 6 shifts a week(4 hours each) and you make your own schedule. You can also cancel a shift if you let them know by noon the day you need to cancel. You are supposed to work 3 shifts a week on average. Also, there are no shifts on Friday or Saturday, so that flexibility is really good as a student.~~I work at a call center. I got hired recently at a call center near our place. i'm just gonna say that i'm not from america but i am bilingual. i'm not gonna go into the specifics of my job since i'm still new. anyway, i got hired last December and passed the assessments. i'm done with nesting but it seems that i didn't pass it. a lot of my wavemates failed as well. we were told we're going to be on extended nesting. when i asked the trainer about failing the nesting stage, i was discouraged.~~I just applied for a call center sales position in one of the large mobile phone service providers in the country. I'm desperate to start a career, not just a new job. I've been led to believe that this position in particular will offer tuition reimbursement along with other benefits. My goal is to use the reimbursement to further education, resulting in a business degree, at the moment likely in accounting, and use this degree to jumpstart my career and hopefully gain some experience, value, and job security.~~I started a new job yesterday. It's a call center job doing tier 1 helpdesk tech support for a financial software company. I have no background in call centers or technical support roles on a professional level/office environment. I was expecting the worst, but the overall first day was relatively decent. My first call was a nightmare though....screaming lady, on hold for an hour, transferred 4 times, 3-day ticket. Had to read up on her ticket notes and familiarize myself with her issue in about 30 seconds while she was screaming at me, at her friend, and her friend screaming at me from across the room. Nerve wracking for the very first call.~~I've been in call center jobs for almost 15 years. I have a bachelors degree in marketing. I'm considering going back to school to get some sort of data analysis training. Does anyone know the best way to go about this? Like what degree should I be looking at? Is there a shortcut in anyway other than getting a masters degree? Those are expensive too! Any advise is appreciated.

9.0,"I worked for a call center. The turnover rate was so high that we had job fairs once or twice a month to keep up with the attrition. I didn't know that the company used a temp agency for hiring. I found out when I was let go. The temp agency that my previous employer used was Randstad.~~A lot of call centre workers express dissatisfaction with their jobs. What's it like working in one? Is it as bad as people say? Or are there some that are actually quite good?~~I work at a call center. It's as bad as everyone says it is.

I am seeking advice on how to get out of this line of work. I would like to find a job in 30 days or less. I am open to any advice or suggestions.~~Recently I was offered a new job, all I need to do is get my references and vetting data in. I'm a bit pessimistic on switching, mostly due to the fact that I hate the prospect of having to leave behind the people in the call centre I work with and the place I've been employed by for over a year and have gotten fairly good at the job. Here are the stats I am looking at for both jobs: Current: Customer service front office for major UK retailer Potential: Retention advisor for Clouds (major UK ISP) Current: 6.90 p/h 40 hours per week, sat-wed 13:30-22:00 Potential initial 7 p/h then 7.50 p/h after probation, rotation 8am-8pm mon-sun (40 hours p/w) Current: Contractor Potential: Contractor Career prospects: None until after graduation, with unknown prospect on post-graduate position Potential: Unknown Red flag: This is a new team, but with that being said there is a welcome event for all potential employees, and my current employer never had anything like this available.~~I recently got a job offer for a call center. I'm really excited because it's a step up from my current job. However, I'm terrified of working the phones again. I'm afraid that I will hate it. I'm also afraid that the management will be awful. I've worked in two call centers before and the management was awful. I'm also afraid that I won't meet my metrics and that I will get fired.~~I work at a call center. It's easy and I get paid decently, but I hate it. I'm looking for something else, and I've been offered a job at a Medieval Times type place.

I'm currently the night manager in a 24/7 call center, in charge of 50 people as well as making sure everything else runs smooth.  I really really like my job, but I have lived in the same town since I can remember and am looking to try a new town before I get too old (I'm 27).  My biggest issue is that I never finished my degree.  I wish that experience counted for more, but that piece of paper counts for more.  I'm not picky about where.  Could I get some advice on cities with a good job market for my particular set of skills?~~I've been in the same call center for 5 years. Mainly service, did a year in sales blended with new credit card application. I am good at what I do. Recently, an opportunity came up for an apprenticeship role, within CS, in the resource officer department. It's a great chance to learn up close and personal what they do, on top of the obvious stepping stone. I've read page and page on interview questions, answers, best answers, prepping, attire, etc. Why am I freaking out? Did I over prepare? Is there such a thing? Am I truly suited for the role? Why should they hire me? What makes me stand out? Gaaaah!~~I worked in a call centre for five years. When I first started, I had a nice manager who played a motherly role. However, after six months I applied for a full-time job and got a new manager who was like Nurse Ratchet. She was sadistic and enjoyed making people's days miserable. I eventually got a new manager who was a lot better. However, the whole time I worked there, I was being recorded. If I did or said anything wrong, I would get sacked. Now, I am off work sick. I am worried I will lose my job because everything is recorded.~~I'm applying for a tech support job at a new call center that just opened up in my college town.

I was locked in a room with a phone. After 35 minutes, it rang. An irate woman stated she had peanut butter, jelly, and bread, and wanted me to make her a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. So I did. I walked her through the process. The curtain behind the great and powerful oz was slipping - I could sense more and more mirth in the 'irate' woman's voice, and as her demands became incredibly more specific, I helped her through them. In the end, I had a sandwich. Two weeks later, I found out I didn't get the job. Because she had interviewed me, I asked why. I got the usual laundry list (not enough empathy, too much small talk, failing to keep talk time down), but the bottom line for her, apparently, was at the very beginning of the call: ""You never confirmed that what I had was, in fact, peanut butter.~~I've been with my company for a year and a half and I'm miserable.

10.0,"I have epilepsy and in the 4th year at the company (with exceeding stats) I decided to have brain surgery to help with the grand mal seizures. The results were amazing but with the result of my language being a little slower (I had to ask my so how to spell five a couple months after the surgery). This didn't cause any issues with the way I spoke with hotels but it did take me a little longer in ACW to write up any notes from the conversation. Now all my stats still meets or exceeds beside my ACW. My supervisor knows what the surgery has caused me and has even graphed out the before/after. I tried to put an accommodation through our FMLA (third party) but they refused. My supervisor hoping to do me a favor asked me to send accommodation info to HR so that he wouldn't have to write me up for my excessive ACW. HR had a meeting with me a few weeks ago saying that I no longer meet the job requirements (ACW) and I would need to find another job in the company within the next 60 days or I would be terminated. Unfortunately the only other position currently open is escalations for customers.~~Hypothetical Friend (HF) calls the reservations department of a hotel. HF asks a hypothetical question about what would happen if extra guests showed up at the hotel. The hotel employee (me) gives a hypothetical answer.

The hotel offered a solution eventually.~~A member of a hotel loyalty program attempted to have a reservation made through a third-party website added to his account so he could earn points.

The employee transferred the call to a manager who reiterated the policy. The guest was not happy and hung up.~~i work for the corporate office for a major travel company. i had taken an escalated call from a lady traveling to dubai for about two weeks. it was a flight and hotel package deal, which she spent a little over 6 grand on. she was already in dubai for three days before she called us complaining that our website false advertised because the hotel looked nothing like what was on our site. i asked her if it was the same resort, she said yes and proceeded to talk about how the hotel was dirty, run down, and not up to date like it showed on the site. essentially the vendor (the hotel in this case) is responsible for updating recent images, so it was out of our control. here is the goofy part; the guest expected us to pay for a new hotel for her, so she decided it would be a bright idea to cancel her reservation and let the hotel process her refund. by this point, the guest is basically homeless for the trip. i sure wasnt going to pay out for it. heres the following scenerio (g for guest m for me) m: so you canceled your reservation, and youre expecting us to pay for a new hotel? g: yes!~~I work in a call center for a pretty well known chain of hotels. we own many brands internationally and we also have a loyalty program for returning customers to earn points and other cool perks. the main job i do is handing reservations (making, modifying, and cancelling them) as well as handling customer inquiries and complaints. most calls are fairly uneventful, but there's a few every week that stand out. the following is one of them.~~I worked in a call center which was a reservations hub for a big hotel chain.

The guest was trying to cancel a reservation at one of the hotels in Atlanta. The hotel worker informed the guest that they needed to cancel the reservation through the website.

A is back at the restaurant and is absolutely livid we won't give it back to her. A's dad acknowledges his daughter was ""an absolute twit"" but the passport needs to be returned as her friend is due to fly out that day to see a dying relative. I explain that under the law, the passport can only be returned to its rightful owner and its the friend who needs to come pick it up not A. A's dad puts me on hold whilst he relays this to A. A is pissed.~~I work for a hotel call center, today i got this call where the first thing i hear is: *lady: your parter hung up on me.* *me: oh ma'am  i'm sorry for the incovenience, can you please tell me what you where doing with my partner?* *lady: well... i wanted to modify my reservation but she put me on hold and the hung up, i gave her all the information.* *me: ok no problem ma'am can i have the booking number?* *lady: yea yea sure, its \*\*\*\** there was some notes on it, the previous agent used hold cause there was an error in the system and she was trying to fix it then the call just dropped. we can not apply the modification if it wasn't confirmed at the end of the call. so i explained the situation to the lady, if we wanted to modify her reservation we had to put again all the info.~~This story was shared on Reddit by a hotel reservations agent.

One of our popular spots was Washington D.C. Many government officials/employees would stay at our hotels. Our policy for almost every hotel in DC was that government employees could stay in a standard room for $80. The price without the discount fluctuated anywhere from $250 to $400. A customer calls in and tries to make a reservation for the day of. Shock, almost everything is sold out. The only room available in the area is a presidential suite. This room seriously went for $3,000+ a night. I even said well unfortunately the only room in the area is the presidential suite at (insert hotel name) going for $3,245 a night plus tax, would you consider a hotel in Virginia and commute over? Customer: oh great! Ill take the suite. Perfect. So I think maybe he's just filthy rich, I don't know. So I just go through the process and read the terms and conditions.~~A hotel reservations agent shares the following story with us: A customer calls to cancel a reservation.

Second floor where exactly? Cus: (camp in town 200 miles away). This is disgrace! Get your ass here and sort it! Room 202. Me: I'm sorry, sir. I'm not physically there, I'm in (town). Cus: I don't give a crap! This is the number on my room door, it's got a local area code, so I'm telling you to get out of that building that I know you are in and clean the sand out of here. -hangs up- Me: I sigh a little, but I'm nothing if not professional and look up the email for the manager of the far away land and send a request.

The guest refused to be transferred and kept insisting on talking to a person. She was getting increasingly frustrated and the employee couldn't help her.~~Yesterday was my last day on the phones. I've only been working there for a few months and tbh, that was well past my expiration there. I've worked customer service for much of my life but man, I've never met such entitled customers than I have in this job. I was hoping for a semi normal day where maybe I'll make a few sales and call it quits and I wanted to at least leave on good terms. But man, what a day. Every single call I had yesterday was an experience but my very last phone call topped it. I had 5 minutes left of my shift so I was like great, I'll take my last call. Looking back now, I should have stayed in ACW or personal and called it but whatever.~~I work remotely from home as a call agent booking hotel rooms. Not surprisingly, the hotels in Houston have been booked for weeks, first with the storm victims and now with insurance adjusters and construction crews. Still, instead of simply telling callers there isn't a room at a location they are calling about, I offer to check other locations in the area for my chain. Several callers have told me they appreciate that I keep trying to find them an availability and combing the area for them.~~Me: Hi, how can I help you? Them: I need you to move me from this hotel. They put me in a disabled room. Me: You'd have to speak with the front desk, I'm sure they'd be happy to move you if they have the availability. Them: I did, they said that's all they had. I need you to move me. I just don't like disabled rooms. Can't stay there. Me: I can't without a supervisor approval. Them: Why? Me: It's your company's policy, I'm sorry. They would need to call us. Them: I guess I'll sleep in my truck then. I'll call back to complain. You should have just moved me. Now I have to sleep in my truck. Cancel my reservation.~~I work at a call center for a hotel chain. We've been offering major overtime benefits to convince us to stay but oh my god guys.

And I keep getting calls like that followed by these... selfish assholes.~~Shankiest works for a big corporate tax prep company. 99.99% of her calls consist of her helping customers with tax questions. That was until a man she will affectionately refer to as ""Holiday Inn Express"" called last night. Right away, she knew something was off. He was talking so fast she could barely understand him. He kept saying double charged, so she assumed he was charged twice for his software. She told him it was no problem, she just needed him to verify his account and she could issue a refund for the duplicate charge.~~Walter works in a reservations call centre for a hotel company. Customer calls in today looking to modify a booking. Call goes something like this: Customer needs to change the dates on his reservation. Walter tells him that this reservation is a non-refundable, non-changeable rate. Customer is not happy. Walter wishes this was a once off but gets at least one of these calls everyday.~~I worked for a call center in a casino. We would make reservations for guests.

The only thing we were wondering about were the seagulls sitting on the surface of the water we rode towards. We never saw them flying away. What happens to them? I hope they didn't die! Colleague responds: Dear..., we are glad to hear, that you had a relaxed holiday and we will try to help clarifying what happens to the seagulls. Due to the two hulls and the general higher position of the catamaran there will be no harm to seagulls, as they pass the hole. They maybe get wet or shaken a bit, but usually nothing more.~~Me: Good afternoon, you're speaking with DarcVox. How can I help you? Cl: Unfortunately, I've had to cancel my cruise. Me: Okay, sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, when you commit to booking one of our cruises and pay a deposit, this is non-refundable when cancelling. Cl: That's daylight robbery! You're telling me that I have to pay money for a cabin I'm not even staying in? Me: Like many other holiday companies, we don't refund monies for cancelling because your daughter has booked her wedding day during your cruise.~~A former call centre worker has revealed the ridiculousness of some customers' demands. The anonymous poster wrote on Reddit that a woman called to book a holiday, but refused to give any details about when she wanted to travel or where she wanted to go. ""She just wanted me to find a holiday for her and her husband,"" the worker wrote. ""I suggested a 21 night holiday in Turkey flying from Glasgow tomorrow.

Her husband had a bad night at our hotel. He travels 5 weeks out of 6 and never stayed at a worse hotel. There were drug deals in the parking lots. Children were running and slamming doors. They wouldn't give him a refund on his room. I gave her the # for customer service. I gave her the email address. I explained to her the difference between reservations and customer service.

Our supervisors are busy, and if we could just help you, that would be better for everyone, including you.  But some people are insistent, and will not listen to reason.  They want to talk to a supervisor, and a supervisor they will talk to, even if it means waiting on hold for a long time, and/or talking to someone who is not a supervisor.

i worked evenings, and generally worked with the british customers unless the american branches were extremely busy and they outsourced to us. but tonight was a slow-ish night, it was nearing the the end of the shift around 8pm when i get a call from rugby guy or rg. i open up with my customer service voice and then it's all down hill. 

rg: good evening, i'm just inquiring about booking 17 rooms for your hotel on these dates and get some prices quoted.

now, i work with general reservation, we can only taking 9 rooms in 1 booking. if a customer needs more than 9, it has to go to group reservations or the in-house reception team. the reason for this is because 1 person will be assigned to that group due to the amount of rooms, and generally they get a much better deal including wifi, breakfast and parking.~~This story was shared on Reddit by a cruise line worker. It has been edited for clarity. WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE. The post I work for a cruise line company, usually booking but get the occasional I have a question about this or that because too lazy to figure it out for myself type thing. well one of our promotions we throw in a free beverage package. cool. its any and all drinks $6.00 and under. mister annoying calls in asking about the drink package that he got and I explain to him. he asks what about higher priced drinks? now in my opinion, you should only have to pay the difference, but if its more than 6 you pay the whole price. I tell him this, and say hey but its ok..just get double the drinks! They're free lol. he starts moaning about how were screwing him and taking the drinking experience away. I say ok..how about the next package up? (12 and under) he decides that seems more up his alley and asks prices. well hes in luck since he got the first package for free hed only have to pay the upgrade charge, not the entire price for the second tier drink package.~~A woman called to confirm a reservation for a conference.

The job is mostly enjoyable, the pay and benefits are amazing. We have an IVR system that takes the caller's info and does everything from making changes or cancels to prepping me with what they want when they get to me. I see the desired location, dates of stay, number of people, etc. The whole idea is that if you are going to have to sit on hold, we want it to be productive and help speed up the call.~~I work in a call center for a large hotel chain.

the add-ons he was looking for is in a different system than the reservation. basically we have 1 system for the cruise, 1 system for add-ons. 

we start with looking at pricing for the beverage package, and then pricing for a 2 device internet package individually. he get's uppity at me for not looking at the combo package that would save him 20 dollars.","But you offered it!~~""You don't want to listen!!!""~~Client holds 20 minutes for an issue we can't do anything about~~By What Stretch is a Request Guaranteed?~~I should have quit when they said the word ""Groupon""~~The time an old woman nearly made me cry~~Tales of the Cruise Line.~~Why do customers not stop talking~~Nickname~~They had balls, I’ll give them that~~Honolulu is on Oahu ma’am~~YOU go fuck YOURself~~'When someone wants to spend money, YOU HELP THEM'~~People never cease to amaze me when it’s through the phone.~~Reservation for a non-existent date~~fuck your hotels, fuck you and fuck this phone~~No I will NOT tell you my location, please and thank you.~~Guest get's frustrated that I don't know what he's looking at. *Kinda long*","A collection of stories from people who work in customer service.

10.0,"we're all used to mindless scripts, chasing impossible stats and dealing with endless entitled customers and guests and we usually end up sounding like a robot....until you get that *one* caller.....   i worked for a third-party call center that took overflow and seasonal calls for a large variety of companies and at the time i was taking customer service calls for a cruise line.  i had been lucky enough to have been on cruises, so it was a great fit, but due to the majority of entitled snowflakes i was getting pretty burned out.  

one of the call types we would get were guests already booked on a cruise calling to arrange and register for shore excursions at the various ports.  this cruise line sold 75% of the spaces on the excursions prior to the cruise and held the other 25% to be sold on the ship once the cruise was underway.  this made it fair for those people who didn't pre-plan every minute of their vacation ahead of time as well as for those who booked last-minute.~~A man called wanting to know why the hotel isn't open. I explained that we're closed on Sunday. He insisted that there's a woman here waiting to check in. She has a reservation today. I asked her if the gentleman who called me needs to talk to me again. She said no.~~A guy called in today and gave me his loyalty number. I pull up the account, and I notice a 4 digit pin number has been set up on the account for security. He says he doesn't remember the pin number but is willing to try. We try 3 different ones, and nothing. Still not a big deal, I just have to reach out to one of my colleagues so they can tell me the security question and answer he has set up so I can get back over to him, verify the account, and help him reset the pin number. The answer he gave me to the question he allegedly set up was nowhere near correct. Then he tells me that he is *potentially* going through a divorce soon, and it's a nasty one from what I can gather.~~For customers who booked hotel rooms through a third party booker (think of websites like booking.com, trivago, expedia or any travel booking website) 

please please please please please please please 

if you have any complaint about the room or the ammenities or anything about the property, approach the front desk agent.

we have absolutely no control of what has or will transpire within the hotel because we don't work for the hotel. we work for the website.

don't call us just to get a refund from the stay  without telling the front desk because  we don't know what the hell went on. this is general customer service and we assist in creating, modifying or cancelling the reservation. if you already checked in and have a complaint, approach the front desk agent so they can resolve your problem with the bed sheets or broken windows or even bugs in the room. becausee?????????? what do you expect us to do? smack them away with travel brochures???????~~My daughter got her first credit card last fall. She paid off the balance, but left 20 cents on it. She didn't get any emails warning her about the late fee, as she was deleting all emails from the company without reading them. When the due date came around, she got charged the late fee. She paid the late fee and the 20 cents, and had a zero balance. However, the late fee (and the 20 cents) were reported to the credit agencies, and her credit score went down 86 points. She is trying to qualify for a mortgage, and this has pushed her credit score below what is acceptable. She has written a letter explaining the situation, apologizing, owning up to her mistake, and promising to be more careful in the future. She got a letter back a few weeks later telling her that they have reviewed her account, but they cannot remove the late report on her credit report.~~I work for a call center company, on a team contracted to a multinational hospitality agency. Basically I work from home taking hotel reservations for any of 1000 different hotels worldwide. Pros: get to work in my underwear, can use 2 computers and play games while I work, never have to meet a coworker or boss in person, etc. Cons: this company is horribly organized. Our entire job revolves around us pretending we work at the property the customer calls for, but we are given minimal information on the property. This means parking fees could be under parking, or under travel, or weather, or anywhere or even not at all. Makes it very hard to maintain the illusion. A lot of customers will immediately hang up if they are told or figure out we are not on-site. Others will demand we give them a discount or some special rate because they are a special person, etc. Does anyone else here work for a company like this?~~Customer: How far is 500 metres? Shootupyourschool: About 550 yards give or take. Customer: In relation to what? Shootupyourschool: Like from here to the shops. Customer: Okay, thanks.~~A lady wants to know if her booking comes with a sim card. It doesn't. She booked the cheapest package. I explain this to her and send her an email with a screenshot of the package details and highlighted the one she had purchased and informed her that should she have needed a sim card, she will be able to choose one of the packages that include one.~~A German tourist called to cancel his reservation.

Cool, figured I'd look that up later. Start entering the info and say ""would you like a king or two twins?"" He says king bed. That's going to be the only bed in the room. Relevant later. Then I say ""and what's your wife's name?"" He goes ""uh actually, I'm not going with my wife."" And I'm like oh okay.~~A few years ago I worked for a ferry company that operates passages to an island in the German Bight. On a Sunday morning I was working together with a colleague when her phone rang. I overheard her very polite and calm tone that indicated to me that she had to deal with a difficult customer. I could not follow her conversation but asked her about it after she hung up: The customer called to book a seat on one of our ships. This ship had only limited seats and no standing areas which means, when all seats have had been booked we were not able to let any more passengers on the ship (similarly to a plane). On that particular day the ship was full since it was in the middle of the high season where customers usually booked several weeks or even months in advance to ensure their passage to the island. So the man wanted a seat on the ship because he had to fetch his wife and daughter. My colleague told him that the ship was full and that there was nothing she could do for him. He started to freak out because it was very important to him to fetch his relatives.~~A woman called to book a room for the 7th. February. Ma'am, it's the 19th already. So she booked a room for the 31st.~~I work in customer service for a large hotel chain. I recently had a guest call in about re-booking for a future reservation, and explaining our cancellation/change policy. The guest was not happy about the deposit price(100 per person for a 1-5 night stay, 250 per person for 6-8 night (their choice for 2 people), 450 per person for 9+). Their logic was that they had already paid a deposit (which was refunded, technically twice) and that if they had to put 'more'money down, they felt like it shouldn't be more than 50 bucks. (deposit amounts are non negotiable, and certificates cannot be used as the upfront deposit) They also complained that not everyone had the same credit amount. I informed them it was based off of the promotion they booked under (buy one get the second person half off) so we should have the people in the same order this time around as well, since we have a similar promo going on now. They said that their bank statements showed they paid the same amount (so they split the whole bill evenly on their own, and not by the per person breakdown) and wanted to have the same amount on each person.~~I work as a hotel operator. I have so many hotel stories to share, but I don't know where to share them. Would it fit better here in r/talesfromthefrontdesk or r/talesfromcallcenters? Any help is greatly appreciated! I had a guest call me up for his reservation and he was looking to cancel. The convo went a little like this: Guest: ""Hey, I need to cancel my reservation."" Me: ""I'm sorry to hear that. Let me just bring up your reservation!"" *computer magic* Me: ""Okay sir, because you're within the cancelation policy, you're subject to a penalty."" Guest: ""What?! Why?! I'm not coming! Why am I being charged?!~~I've worked in a call center for one of the biggest travel companies/entertainment divisions in the world for six years. I've been working at home for three.

Same company, just extra hours. I only did chat, but I loved it.~~This story takes place in a call center. A man calls to make a reservation. The call center worker asks for his e-mail address. The man gives an e-mail address of bigwanker***@*******. The man explains that one day he was in a hotel on corporate business. His boss came to his room, but he was naked. She made him the e-mail address, and he's not allowed to change it.~~I am a little confused on how to calculate the price for the extra room. The policy says that cancellations or changes made after 3:00 pm on May 16 or no shows are subject to a property fee. It also states that change of plans? No problem, you can cancel for free before Saturday, May 16. I understand that the change is allowed without any extra fee on the roleplay where the customer is calling on January 16 since she still had a lot of time to make changes. However, it does not show the price of 1 night. It only shows the total price for the 2 nights plus taxes which is $138.00 taxes per night. How am I suppose to do the math?","Ever have that one moment of ""clarity""?

The post, written by u/throwrawwater, recounts an interaction with a customer who refused to listen to her instructions on how to fix his internet. The man demanded to speak to a male supervisor before he would try the solution she suggested. After some back and forth, the supervisor took the phone and helped the customer solve the problem.

We serviced mainly rural areas which I'm sure you all know this means the technical understandings of most customers was on the level of about a 5 year old patch of moss. However my strangest and most satisfying call had nothing to do with technical understanding, I had a woman call in reporting her internet was down, she stated she had shut off her computer and modem because a bad storm was coming and when she plugged it back in it didnt work. Assuming she had plugged something in wrong I started pulling up her account and I saw services were disconnected for non-payment. Her account was past due, by $2,800. I was confused as to how her internet was working until the day before, as the disconnect order was placed after 60 days.

I could see that the router had no IP address. The customer told me that the modem and router were plugged in but there was no power in the room because of renovations.

We recently lost our contract with the local phone company, and as a result lost a lot of business. Most of our customers are pretty unhappy, understandably. We're no longer allowed to support their Internet connections, so they have to go directly to the phone company for help, which is a problem because the phone company provides terrible support. We have a lot of customers who have been with us for 15-20 years, and they're sad to be leaving because our call center gives great 24/7 support and the phone company does not.~~I work in tech support for a very well known phone, tv and isp provider and this is one of the only calls that i legit had to go into acw for just to laugh from how ridiculous it was. 

typically if a customer calls in, the ivr will ask them to verify their info so we get a screen pop. this does not always happen (sometimes a customer's old account comes up, another customer's call drops just before they get on the line, etc.), so it is required that we verbally verify the customer's account for security reasons before proceeding to help them. 99% of the people i speak with, do not make a big deal out of it. then there's this guy...~~So I used to take calls at an ISP. As you can guess all my calls were problematic since people act like someone butchered their puppy in front of them when their internet doesn't work. But some people are so clueless about how internet works it was appalling. Anyway. One afternoon I get a call. The customer says the internet is out. I get his info, check and tell him the internet is out because a fibre optic cable has been broken in his area. I inform him that our field team is working on it and the internet will come back online shortly.

11.0,"So I work for a major ISP. This call center is amazing to work for, only complaint is lack of wrap up time between calls. That being said the customers are the worst part. This is a pretty normal call but she just felt so exhausting.~~Customer returns a damaged modem to the office. They insist they didn't break the modem and refuse to pay the replacement fee. After multiple extensions and promises to pay, the equipment is remotely disabled. The customer continues to call and complain that they did not break the modem and want it fixed for free. A tech is scheduled to come out and physically disconnect the equipment. The customer calls back the next day and admits that they broke the modem. They want to pay the bill and have the equipment turned back on.~~I worked a tax site for H&R Block. This was several years ago, but it's still one of my favorite stories. A customer called in because he couldn't get e-file to work. My coworker took him through several steps that didn't work. Finally, she had him check his modem. The customer told her he had it wrapped in tinfoil to prevent the government from spying on him.~~I work in a call centre. We get angry and uncooperative customers from time to time, but this woman took the cake. She was drunk, loud, and generally unpleasant to talk to. I tried to help her with her internet, but she didn't want to cooperate at all. She kept yelling that she couldn't hear me and demanded to be transferred to another agent. I told her that no other agents were available and that this was our standard troubleshooting procedure. She was not happy and eventually hung up on me.~~I worked in a call centre for a broadband company. My first call was tech support. The customer had a very heavy accent and I couldn't understand him. He was also using a Spanish version of Windows.

I'm calling about your modem issues. We cannot see anything wrong with your modem. You aren't losing any packets, the connection is perfect. Unfortunately, the only way you can do that is through customer service as it is considered an install with a charge. I'm going to have to send a technician to do this. I have to advise you of the possible charges-- Crashed Modem? Due to Destruction of Equipment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?~~I work in customer support for an ISP. We use another provider's phone lines because they own pretty much everything in Ireland in terms of exchanges and phone lines. So we use their engineers. The box guy. (as a friend rightfully called this story) Me: Good morning, you're through to this company, my name is Thor, how can I help you today? Entitled box guy: I want to complain and speak to a manager! Me: Oh? May I ask what this is about and I can possibly help you? Entitled box guy: You activated my broadband earlier! I had my other provider to cancel off on the 13th! You've activated it on the 11th! This is not acceptable! My broadband isn't working!! Me: Okay. I apologise that your broadband has been activated before your expected activation date. Because we use such and such's lines. We go by their engineers and sometimes if they are in the area doing a job, they will activate your line early for you. Would you mind telling me how many lights are on the hub? Entitled box guy: The hub's not plugged in!

In the end, the technician asks her to contact the router company.~~I work in a call center. Today, after dealing with many similarly frustrating customers over chat, a customer came into chat asking why her internet modem had reset at 2:20am and why her wifi password was no longer working. Sure enough, after checking the logs of the modem it did appear to have reset around 2am but it was back online in good shape. I advised the customer that I couldn't say why that occurred (as we don't have that information) as it could have been a number of reasons, but I told her we could try factory resetting her modem and then we would change her wifi password to something secure again. The customer immediately went off the rails demanding to know if her modem was being hacked and if her data was safe, and immediately asked for a callback from a manager so that they can review the logs of this incident with her. I told her that our manager, who does not have access to any secret tech support tools that we did not and was also the manager of the CSR's, was in no better position to help and that it was highly unlikely she (the customer) was being hacked unless somebody actually physically reset the modem.~~A customer wanted compensation for a free service. Her internet and TV worked fine but she wanted compensation for a free recording package. The support couldn't compensate her because she didn't pay for the service. The customer was not happy and wanted to speak to a manager. The first manager said no, the second one did too. The customer was very angry and hung up the phone.~~Ever had a tech support call that made you want to bang your head against a wall? Share your story with us. We'd love to hear it. (And we promise we won't laugh.~~I've been doing technical support for an ISP for 7 years. I've seen just about every issue that can come up. And I still can't understand why so many customers refuse to believe that their equipment can be at fault. Even when it's completely oblivious where the issue is coming from. Last night, I had a customer call in with wireless connectivity issues on his smart TV. No problems with any other devices, his laptop can connect to the exact same wireless signal, at the same time that his TV can't find the wireless signal. We've sent multiple technicians out to verify our modem, even swapped it out for another one, and the issue has continued. So I tried to explain all this to the customer logically, which I know never works. I went over the account history, the technicians, and explained that it really looks like the issue is coming from the TV itself, not our service or equipment. I explained that I believe he needs to contact the TV manufacturer, which is Samsung, and have them look at the TV itself. Of course, this just gets me ""it's not my TV! If this keeps up, I'm through with your company and I'll cancel my service!!!"".~~I work in a call center. Most of our calls are pretty straightforward: help the customer with their internet/cable/phone problem and then thank them for their time. Every once in a while, a call comes in that makes me question how the person on the other end of the line became a customer in the first place. I've had people tell me they're going to put their modem in the fridge to cool it off, and people who have had a tornado go through their backyard the day before. But the worst one so far has to be when I accidentally said ""speaking"" instead of ""speaking with"". I quickly corrected myself, but I was so nervous the rest of the call I was expecting the customer to hang up at any moment.~~$Customer$'s internet works for 30 minutes, then it goes out. $Me$ suggests there may be an issue with the router. $Customer$ refuses to let $Me$ run tests, claiming that modern computers don't have ethernet ports. $Customer$ hangs up.~~A woman called her ISP's tech support because her internet wasn't working. It turned out that she had just activated her internet today. The support agent walked her through the setup steps. However, the woman didn't own a telephone socket, so she couldn't plug her router in.~~A customer hasn't had any connection for almost five days. The customer has a new modem. The customer wants a repair dispatch after business hours. The ISP doesn't do appointments after four pm.

Oh the call centre went bankrupt a year after I left.~~Customer service can be a tough gig.

11.0,"I work in a call center. We handle payments for a large variety of companies. I love it when I tell people they can't make a payment online because their internet is down, and they respond with ""well how am I supposed to pay then?"". Like, seriously, there are so many ways to pay. Call the company and pay over the phone. Use public WiFi at a coffee shop to pay. Go to the bank and pay with a teller. Use an ATM. Pay with a kiosk. The list goes on.~~I work for a cable company. A technician was supposed to go to a customer to upgrade their internet speed. I noticed that the customer already had the required modem, so I increased the speed from my end. I called the customer to cancel the appointment. The customer was very angry and yelled at me for over 30 minutes.~~A former IT worker has shared the story of his frustrating experience trying to set up a new internet service. After calling the company's customer service line, the man was subjected to an aggressive upsell for a bundle that included TV, phone and faster internet. The customer rejected the offer and asked to be put through to the company's supervisor. The supervisor was able to process the order for the man's desired plan.~~A Comcast customer service representative tells a customer that her modem died. The customer says that it might have happened when she washed it. The representative then tells the customer that she will have to pay $175, because the call isn't covered under faulty equipment. The customer then asks to speak to a supervisor.~~A customer calls the help desk because she cannot access the Internet. After going through the usual spiel, it turns out the customer sold her PC because she didn't use it anymore. She is now trying to access the Internet with her laptop, which is currently being repaired. It turns out that the customer has misunderstood the concept of wireless Internet. She thought that it would be possible to access the Internet without any device connected to the router.~~I work at a 24/7 call center for people who have problems with their internet(dsl, fiber, cable, wireless). we handle calls from a couple small isps providing support for their email, internet,and occasionally turning it off and on again powercycling equipment. i actually have very little skill with computers other than my incredible ability to google, i basically got the job due to a friend who already worked in the company vouching for me (luckily they had on the job training). everyone who has ever worked anywhere knows that you sometimes get customers that make you question your and their sanity, this is one of my favourites.~~A Comcast customer service representative was trying to help a customer download Google Chrome.

so i did what any smart techie would do. i went and bought my own. called and had the mac address registered etc. about a week later i go to their local office to return the old modem so i don't have to pay the rental fee. 

the sitch: so last saturday i wake up to find my service is not working. i call in figuring there would be a non outage report recording. nope. their system says i terminated service. guy at the office didn't enter my return properly so they cut me.

Today was rough. I had a customer with a 3rd party modem and router trying to set up a wireless security system box called Canary. I had another customer upgrade to Windows 10 and was seeing a black screen. I had a third call about a smart TV with Hulu that kept buffering. I was able to help the first two customers. The third one was difficult because he kept asking me to fix the problem instead of running the speed test I requested. I am ready to go home.~~I work in call centre of company that offers internet and tv. I got call from client that had problem with his tv. After quick diagnosis I realised that it's because he choose wrong source in tv options. He had 2 devices plugged in and now miraculously he developed amnesia on how to do it. (after like 15 min of explaining it to him how to press buttons and switching to hdmi (he used scart) we managed to choose right source). Then he started complaining that we limit his access to channels. I couldn't straight forward explain it to him that he just doesn't have them in his offer (because he failed authorization and because of that I can't talk about details of account). Still I explained to him that those channels are broadcasted to him. He still didn't understand that even if I was basically explaining it in really simple way and also he couldn't grasp the concept of failing authorization. Then after that he started complaining about the cc service apparently his internet connection customer service is way better (spoiler alert he use our internet). And I told him that it's same company and he couldn't believe that and started complaining how we scheme around to destroy his tv watching.~~A member of staff has complained about the quality of your work calls.

Still not good enough, he wants to be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars he lost. Really?~~About 7 years ago I was a network support in a bank. I get this call: ""We don't have network, nothing is working, intranet email internet core banking system swift, everything is down, what is this lousy service from it??!!"".

I hate it so much I've been looking for other jobs for over a year. I'm not sure what I want to do, but I know I hate what I'm doing now. I don't think I'm alone in this. I've talked to other IT people and, while they don't hate their jobs, they don't love them either. Why is this? What is it about IT support that makes so many people hate it? Is it the pay? The working conditions? The people? The customers? Being an IT support person is a unique job. There are many reasons to love it, but also many reasons to hate it. In this article, I want to explore both sides of the issue.~~I work for a cable company. We don't support LastPass.

I placed her on hold to reset the password since it is encrypted. I get back on the line and tell her that her new password is '123456'. It takes her nearly 45 seconds to write this down and confirm this password with me, she then asks me what case the numbers are in... I advised her that the numbers have no case sensitivity. She says, 'so they are upper case?' I say, 'no, they have no case sensitivity.' She then asks me what language I am speaking in... I say, 'english' She then says, 'oh...so they are in lower case?'

He is paying $75 for internet which isn't too bad for the speed he has and mentioned I can get it down to about $60 for the internet for 6 months. He then throws a bombshell on me, what about my TV service as well? Looking all around his account he never had TV service not even a box was registered to his account or name. I decided to probe for info and was able to get him to give me the serial number on the box. It was registered to a lady which happens to be his sister. And looking at her account that box is online and receiving. He was stealing cable from us and his sister gave him the box to plug in. The line on the outside box ended up being plugged in by him. I immediately turned off his modem and his sister's account. My supervisor was in the mean time calling the sister to inform them. We told them that both accounts will be suspended until the 2 years of cable that box has been receiving is paid.

If I received enough kudos I would get a big bonus. The first week I worked there I got a lot of kudos. Then I got a floor manager who started pushing me to leave the company.

He would get calls from customers whose service had been cut off. In order to get the service working again, he would have the customer rub half a potato on the box. The reason this worked was because there was a hidden button on the box, and by rubbing the potato, you would hit the button. He would then send a signal to the box, and the service would be restored.~~I've worked for a cable company for years now, started as a service tech, now thankfully work on the main lines (much harder work, but the customer free environment is worth it).  I used to run all service calls (very rarely did installs).  I get a call to this customer's home for a morning appointment, for missing channels on one tv, while the other was showing the channels.  It's certainly an account issue, which means all I can do for the customer is call in to my dispatcher and have her fix the codes on the account.  I can see the codes on my handheld, but they're all two letter codes, and while I know what a few are, and can guess a few more, I don't know the specifics of what they stand for.  But, the ""working"" TV has a couple extra codes on it than the other, so that's definitely the issue.  I show up, check signal levels, send hits, basically put on a show for the customer knowing nothing I was doing was actually going towards fixing his issue.  On top of everything else, my handheld would only function correctly in speaker mode.  So I call up my dispatcher...~~I work for sales at a smaller cable company that does not service areas where the bigger guys are at like comcast/tw/etc.  we do not have the ability to offer some of the free deals with hbo/starz/cin/show which when setting up new people and they ask for that they get mad we do not offer it.  but i have never gotten asked to price match someone before because well in this field that does not happen at all.

Needless to say, people are freaking out. So I have this guy who has called in three times today, once two days ago and also on the 11th, demanding $1 per day per channel that the banner is scrolling on bc he pays for a full screen not 7/8ths of a screen and he is concerned the banner will be putting a burnt image on his screen.

The woman had in fact cancelled her cable service exactly one year ago. The cable company had made a mistake and failed to send the signal to stop the woman's access to streaming. The woman had been receiving a $25/month service, plus all of the cable channels, for free for over a year. The worker spent several minutes explaining the situation. He eventually offered to transfer the woman to the sales team to add the service, but made it clear that he would not charge her.~~This is my first time posting here so go easy on me. I work for a cable company that provides internet and phone. Guess who lol. I am the next thing to a supervisor so I handle frontline escalations and overrides on a daily. An agent calls our escalation line stating a customer is upset because the tech did not install their two new cable boxes and told them they should use roku devices instead. Ok...que me reviewing the notes and recent work orders on the account. The tech marked the order resolution as complete due to unsafe conditions. The notes state he called his supervisor who then called dispatch stating there was feces in the basement and tech could not complete the job until it was cleaned up. I got my giggles out and prepared to take the call.~~I work at a call center for a cable/internet provider. I had a woman call and ask about why her internet wasn't working. I let her know it was because the bill was not paid, and had been interrupted for a few weeks. She told me that she had been trying to get in contact with our customer service multiple times, but didn't have the two+ hours to sit on hold. I could tell she was getting frustrated. On a personal note, I had just found out the day prior about one of my parents getting cancer. I had been screamed at all day, and was starting to catch a tone by saying well I can see the wait times for this call and they were only nine minutes, etc. We eventually restored her services and got her enrolled in a discount program for her bill so she can keep her services on while she works on paying the bill.~~I worked in a call center for a major cable company for a few years. The call center was contracted through another company, but most of the calls were from customers of the cable company. I'm sure you can imagine the kinds of calls I received. People are angry, people are frustrated, people are confused. And it's not just one or two calls a day, it's literally hundreds of calls a day. Most of the calls were not pleasant, but there were some that were actually kind of funny. I'm not sure if it's because I was just so used to hearing angry people on the phone, or if people were actually starting to become funny. Either way, after a while you start to get a feel for the different kinds of personalities that call in.~~I work for a cable and internet provider and am in a very specific department for a very specific line of customers. however, from time to time a non-related call will weasel it's way into my queue and i get to deal with it. today's horror story is brought to you by the billing department....... all identifying factors of this story have been changed in order to maintain company and customer privacy. we shall lovingly refer to the customer as mr. dingbat. *ring**ring** me- ""hello! thank you for calling credits-r-us. how may i assist you today?"" mr. dingbat - ""yes, i am calling to get the credits i was promised for the last year of horrible service i have been receiving. i was promised by the last agent that i deserved a jumbo credit.

Working at a call center when you hate your job is even tougher. But working at a call center when you hate your job and have serious back pain? That's a whole other level of torture.

The post, by user dangerdann, details a call with a customer who was ""yelling"" at him because she couldn't figure out how to use the cable box. The customer had ""69 pages of notes on the account"". After ten minutes, dangerdann set up a trouble call and switched the box off.

It says there's a software error and it won't load. It's been unplugged for two years. Me: Well, if it's been unplugged for two years, of course it won't work. I can send a technician or you can go to the store. Her: No! I want credit for those two years!! Me: Well, I'm sorry, but that's not a valid request.~~I was a cable customer service rep for a little over a year. I dealt with all kinds of people, good and bad. I learned a lot about people and how they act and react to certain situations. I'm sure a lot of you have had the same types of experiences with customer service reps as I have. But I bet you haven't had one quite like this.~~I used to work for a cable company, a big one in the US. We took calls exclusively from NYC. There was a big storm and the city was hit hard. Trees down everywhere, utility lines down with them, flooding, the works. We were slammed with calls, hundreds in queue. So I take a call, the guy on the other end is clearly annoyed by the wait, and just the general, shittiness of the day. ""My cable is out"", so I response with some customer service crap, apologizing and expressing how frustrated I would be in the same situation, blah blah, but trying to be genuinely understanding and help him out, knowing I probably can't do anything. Knowing the situation my first question, do you currently have power? ""No, my power is out"". So now if you cable box has no power how do you even know the cable is out?? But anyway, I keep that to myself, and ask if he has called the power company to get an ETA for when the power will be back? He replies ""ya, I called them, they said lines are down everywhere and it might be a few days, possibly even a week, crazy right?~~I work in an inbound isp call center. just got this call. dumbass caller shall be known as dc. &gt;me: can you please unplug the power cord from the entone set top box for me? &gt;dc: you mean restart it? is that what you want??

13.0,"yesterday i get an escalation from an agent with an irate customer, i'll call him goober face (gf). he was unable to get some of his channels on his cable box in his bedroom. 

so the agent went through the troubleshooting steps and determined that he was missing hd channels in his spare room. turned out his cable box in the spare room was not an hd box. when told this, gf became irate, started swearing at the agent, and **demanded** a sup. 

i pull up the account, thinking that this may be a new account, the cx wasn't aware he didn't get hd service in all his rooms. easy fix if it is within the first 30 days of service...right? **wrong!** gf has had this equipment for a **year**. i also pulled up the original installation order, and low &amp; behold, the order was for (3) standard boxes and (1) hd box. this tells me that gf probably didn't want to pay the slightly higher monthly rental fee for hd boxes on all his tvs, so he got an hd box for his main tv and went with standard for the rest.~~A Comcast customer service rep posted this story on Reddit. It's a perfect encapsulation of the worst parts of dealing with terrible customers. Enjoy. 

I work for a cable company that also supplies internet service. we offer an option to use our equipment or customer-owned modem/router. the downside to using your own router is that, because it doesn't belong to us, we can't log into it to change settings, passwords, etc.~~Customer retention representative: Hi, I work for a fairly large cable company though if you don't live in our service area you likely have not heard of us. I work in customer retention. When people call in because they want to reduce their bill, the first thing we do is make sure they aren't paying for things they don't need. Next step, try a different package. This customer, she gave me the ""I don't watch TV that much but I want every channel, HD DVR in every room for when I do, but TV isn't that important"". We couldn't find anything that fit exactly what she wanted. We found one that almost worked, basically she was losing a channel she watched but was close to the price she wanted. What she said next blew my mind.~~My friend recently took a job with a company that makes cable/phone/internet sales calls for several major providers. The campaign my friend was on this day was for customers that already have internet, to offer a discounted upgrade to high speed. My friend approached a customer who had been a subscriber for 2 years. The customer did not need the internet connection because she had a wireless router.~~I work for a call center that's contracted by a cable provider to call existing customers and set them up with new services at promotional prices. So I call this Indian dude with a super thick accent and pitch him our starter cable package. It comes with free HBO or Starz. I put in the promo codes and submit the order. Fast forward to a month later, he calls in someone had changed my order, put it to a higher package and charged him for HBO and installation, which should have been free. I tell him I don't have the power to change his account once the order has processed and I can get him through to the people that can.~~Me: Hi, how can I help you today? Customer: I'm not going to pay for this month of service. Me: I see. Why is that? Customer: Because my cable was disconnected on the 15th, and I shouldn't have to pay for the days after. Me: I see. You're right. I'll disconnect your service. Customer: Great. Thanks.~~A transcript of calls to a cable company customer service line.

I work in an inbound call center for a cable company. Most of the time, people call to yell at you about getting flyers. They don't realize that we cannot control the flyers. It's just a waste of time and energy.~~A woman who works in a call centre revealed the worst part of her job on Reddit. The anonymous user said she mainly handles billing and troubleshooting. Yesterday, she had a man call her who complained about the services. He yelled at her and berated her for 23 minutes. She fixed his issue and he was happier. He then told her that he is going out for coffee with her and that he will pick her up. She declined his offer.~~I work for a cable company that specializes in apartment buildings, our company in particular has bought out some smaller cable companies, and divisions that specialize in apartment buildings as well. the big issue is that the companies we acquried used the cheapest equipment in their buildings equipment rooms, so equipment goes out all the time. today i had a lady call in: Me: Thank you for calling cable co, my name is dogcmp6, how can I help you? Cust: I want to know why my HD channels are not working, and I want to know right now. Me: Mam, can I have your account number and address so I can pull up your account? Cust: Verification info. Me: Mam, there is a known issue at your property in the head end, unfourtnetly I am unable to provide an ETA as we are still working to repair the issue.

He wanted a technician to come out to his house ASAP because his football games were in standard definition, not high definition. I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I left a few seconds of silence go by just to absorb what this guy just told me. I took his info and sent it to the technician. Never found out if that guy got his games ""fixed"".~~I work in a call center. My job is to take calls from customers who want to order pay-per-view shows. I also handle calls from customers who have ordered pay-per-view shows and are having technical difficulties. I have heard it all. The most interesting calls I get are the ones from people who try to deny that they ordered the pay-per-view shows that appear on their bill. Some people actually try to convince me that their cat must have stepped on the remote and ordered the shows. I have also had people admit that their teenager ordered the shows, but they still want credit. I politely tell them that since their son is old enough to order shows like that, he should be responsible enough to take care of the charges for it.~~A couple of weeks ago, I got a phone call at work that made me chuckle. The caller wanted to know what the DNS server address was for our web site. I asked him what he needed it for, and he replied that he was trying to configure his computer to use our service.

I'm trained in both collections and admin operations so I'm often the lone wolf. Weekends are the slowest days so response times are super quick for all forms of contact. The customer in question, let's call her Karen, had her repayments on hold due to apparent financial hardship. These holds only happen for one month but then require further assessment for legitimate financial trouble. Her month was at its end and a payment was due.~~My buddy was getting collection calls for a cell phone debt his wife supposedly owed. She had a monthly plan for $30 or $40 or whatever it was, and there were supposed to be no surprises. This was six years ago, and there were surprises. She owed an extra $40 one month.

No, you owe it to your bank and if you don't pay it does not hurt us.~~A guy called me today trying to bait me into admitting that his account was in good standing or current because he made $x.xx towards his bill when that didn't even cover half of what was owed.

Kevin has another payment due on date.~~I worked in a department that dealt with PPI complaints. This was during the time when PPI was a big scandal in the UK. The company I worked for gave credit cards to people that other companies wouldn't dare to give cards to. This meant that they had a lot of bad debts. If PPI was mis-sold we would send a letter to the customer offering a refund. Underneath the signature area, it would state that if the customer's account was not in good standing, then the refund would be used to offset any debt. I would have to explain to customers why they were not receiving their refunds. This was because their account was in bad debt status.~~A debt collector offers a client a 6 months 0% interest program. The client wants it applied immediately.

The client is still dissatisfied.~~A customer calls to explain that the account that was opened in her name, but never paid, was in fact a case of fraud. The customer was absolutely furious that such a thing could happen and demanded we take immediate action to resolve the issue and correct her previously immaculate credit file. I apologise and do my best to reassure the customer we would get to the bottom of the issue. However, upon further review, I notice that the account address for billing and shipping matches the address the customer confirmed when running through security. Therefore, I advise the customer she would need to report the issue to the police and call back with a crime reference number. At this, the customer explodes, screaming at me she explains her darling son (15) was in fact the one that took her details, opened the account in her name and ordered the phone she refused to buy him so she cannot possibly go to the police because what kind of a mother reports her own child to the police? And anyway, this is clearly our fault for having such lenient processes so if I don't write the debt off she will report us to the press.~~Collection agent deathtocrispix shares another day on the job.

One of our jobs was to call people who hadn't paid their bills in order to get them to pay. She told me that my company had put her into collections for a bill that she didn't owe.

He is not satisfied and threatens to report my company to the Better Business Bureau.~~A customer wants to cancel a service. The account is suspended, due to non-payment, but not fully cancelled yet. Sadly, I can't cancel the account. I have to transfer the call to our team that handles collections and deactivations for accounts that are in collection. I call that department and brief the agent about what the customer wants. I conference the customer into the call, introduce the agent from the other department, then disconnect to take the next incoming call. But it's a pretty slow day. And wouldn't you know it, a few minutes later, I get a call. And it's the same agent I just transferred the customer to. Transferring me back the same customer. Because, as it turns out, the customer after I completed the conference, told the collections agent that they wanted to dispute a charge on the bill. And you see, collections agents do not deal with bill disputes, they only deal with collections. So that's why the collections agent needed to transfer the call back to customer service. I tell him I understand, and to complete the conference. When it comes to bill disputes, if its a legitimate billing error we'll adjust it no question.~~So I used to work for an automotive financial collections call center for a while and have heard just about everything. this one always sticks out to me as a very sad case where education has truly failed people. (tldr at the end) Quick explanation for people who dont have/are unfamiliar with car loans Most car loans are simple interest loans, which means (unless you have 0% apr) your interest amount depends on your apr, the time you take to pay off the loan, and your current principle balance. The amount of interest you assess per day is called your per diem rate and changes as time goes on/you pay more. If you're late on your monthly payment, you incur more interest based on your current per diem rate. A part of my job is to educate customers on how being late costs them more money as an incentive to pay on time. As a reference this guy was late very early into a high balance loan. M- me     cc- clueless customer

I generally don't like my job, but I try to do it well. I'm not a monster, and I don't want to make anyone's life worse than it has to be. I also don't want to lose my job, so I do what I'm told. Today I had a call with a lady who couldn't pay her bill. It wasn't due until the first of August, but she was in a panic about it. I tried to explain that I couldn't just clear her account and let her pay later. We went back and forth for a while, and eventually I processed her payment for 60 dollars. I don't know if she'll be able to pay the rest later, but I hope she can.~~So I work at a debt collection agency. We have an automatic messaging system that tells clients 3 days in advance before every withdrawal and sends a message if a payment fails. It's important to note that these messages are automatic and actually say ""do not reply"".

Client: Yeah, I've been messaging you guys to fix this!~~This story was a couple months ago while I was working at a large cell phone carrier in the United States. For some background, the company switched their billing system completely back in 2013. When they did so, all the accounts that were in collections were sold off to the debt collector's and they didn't carry over to the new system. We couldn't look up account numbers, phone numbers, nothing. They weren't there.~~Collections agent has a run in with a debtor who refuses to pay. Debtor claims the company is a scam and will not pay. Agent explains that the company does not sell debts and that debtor can pay or risk a default.

He also wants to cancel his service, but the company cannot provide a refund. The customer threatens to throw the machine in the front yard and not pay for any damages.

Debt collector then disconnects the call after debtor swears at him. Feels good, man.~~A while back I posted about a debtor of ours refusing to pay and directly challenged our debt collection firm. He tried to abuse the law to his advantage. I appeared in claims court today as one of the representatives of the firm. We won. All of it. And compensation for failure to meet demands relating to legally warranted funds, as well as all of the court fees being placed on the debtor. Our legal team was at his local court and we were conferenced in via telephone. I could hear his ego vaporize when the ruling was read by the officer of the court.~~Ray Johnson is a debt collector.

The debtor is not happy and hangs up on him.~~Me: Hi there customer, I'm rutlege from company, how are you doing today? Customer: (slurred) Yeah I'm good, what are you after mate? Me: I'm just calling in regards to your outstanding cash converters loan, it's still outstanding at $124.56, were you in a position to pay that in full today? Customer: Nah mate, I don't think so. Me: Well, if you aren't able to pay in full, how much are you able to commit towards this on a weekly basis? Customer: Look mate, I'm gonna be honest with you, I'm aboriginal. Me: Okay.. And what does that entail, exactly? Customer: It means I can't stand up straight, mate, you get me? Me: Okay.. Sorry, but you're amount is still outstanding regardless of that, customer.~~This story was told by a former debt collector. The names have been changed to protect the guilty. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.   So this is something that happened to me many years ago when i worked as a debt collector.  if you've never worked in collections... don't.  its easily the most soul sucking job i've ever done.  

anyway, at this job we worked in-house accounts from 4-6 months overdue in an attempt to keep them from charging off to a collection agency.  at this point we were desperate to show that we could improve our roll off percentage so management allowed us to clear out any accounts that were mostly late fees if we could trace back to the original purchase and said purchase was less than $20.~~I worked for a call center in the collections department. I got sick recently and spent over a month off work. When I returned, I just didn't have the same patience. Yesterday, a lady called and said her balance was wrong. I explained that her bill was correct and she needed to learn reading comprehension skills. She hung up and I sent my immediate resignation by email. I felt so liberated.

CZjayg: My name is CZjayg calling from Blah Blah Company. Am I speaking with John Smith? Customer: That depends what you're calling about. CZjayg: It's a personal business matter. Am I speaking with John Smith or can he be reached at this number? Customer: Well I'm not confirming anything until you tell me why you're calling. Cue CZjayg hanging up and getting a QA warning.

We've just recently acquired a new client who has all their customer services based in South Africa and in Asia - their customer care team are absolutely terrible to the point where myself and a few of my colleagues have had to ban certain members of their team from calling our office due to their poor conduct and general wastage of our time. The client isn't especially happy at this, but we provide them 40,000 in collections a month, so they can sit on their thumb. So terrible are our client's customer services that customers are now actively and intentionally letting their bills go to the debt recovery stage just so they can deal with someone in the UK. As someone who deals with collections, there are certain cultural values in the UK that do not translate to these oversees care teams.~~Customer calls to ask why she was declined for a loan. Unfortunately, there is an unpaid default on her credit file from 2011 and that's put her outside of our criteria, says the operator. The customer is confused as she thought defaults were removed after 5 years. Awkward.~~Karen is angry because she was denied a home loan. Me and my company appear on her credit report.

The story was shared on Reddit by u/throwitaway22 and has since received over 33,000 upvotes. It involves a client who was trying to get a $50 credit applied to his account even though he had used his service daily. The call center employee refused to credit the account until a technician had checked the client's equipment. The client became increasingly angry and abusive. Eventually, the employee cancelled the client's service and he hung up.~~I worked in debt collection for a while. One of the accounts I was chasing belonged to a solicitor. He was very intent that I knew about his degree. The outstanding debt was 3,000 in property taxes which were passed to us by a real-estate firm that had been chasing this guy for a while. It had been passed to me due to the fact that I can deal with business matters better than most of my colleagues who are from the old generation of debt collection which is essentially bashing down doors and taking items.~~So I work at a collections agency that is contracted for tax collections. At one point, one of the collections agents gets a phone call. It's a guy who is calling asking for information from the employee. And I'm talking about personal information, like DOB, name, etc. Eventually the collector forwards it to their supervisor. The supervisor is pretty incompetent to begin with, and is pretty terrible at handling any sort of escalation calls (not sure how he became a supervisor). Anyway, the guy hangs up. Seems like it would be over. Except he keeps calling back on different lines for different collectors. I suspect at this point he is most likely a disgruntled taxpayer who figures they will get a little petty revenge on the collection agency. So the obvious option would be to block his phone number. But we can't because he's by some means using one of our office numbers to call another office number. So you would figure, ""maybe we should just ignore his calls?"". Nope. Instead, the entire management staff will try to talk to this guy (who is now calling from multiple lines simultaneously) to try and get him to stop.~~I worked at a call center doing collections. I called a lady and got the disconnected number message, including the 3 tones that tell an automated dialer that the number is disconnected. Twice. I was bored so I hadn't hung up. Then I get this: ""If you made this far, you must be a friend or family member. Please leave a message after the beep.~~So I work in collections for an electric company.

The other day I had a very pleasant woman call in trying to keep her electric from being disconnected.   me: good morning, thank you for calling (company), my name is (name), may I ask who I'm speaking with? cust: yeah my name is (cust)  ...went over account info... told her the account bal, which was over $1500.00 ... (as I looked over the account, I noticed that I had spoken with her a few weeks before, but she didn't remember my name, which isn't uncommon) cust: i can pay $150.00 me: well, in order to avoid disconnection, you'll need to pay at least $1200.00 (or so) cust: i can't do that. me: I do apologize ma'am. but that is what is needed. i can also see that you haven't made a payment since you opened the account.~~My job involves doing a bit of everything. One of the things I do is work with a live chat service. We used to use it all the time, but now only I know how to use it. A customer contacts me through the live chat asking for her payout figure. I tell her the payout figure as at 30/10/2020. She makes a payment of $300.

The woman refuses to pay her debt unless the debt collector fixes the bill. The debt collector sends her a bill written in crayon. The woman still refuses to pay. The debt collector sends her a bill written in braille.~~I worked in a call center for a while. Most of the collection departments I dealt with were a part of a call center. I'm a naturally nice person. I'm also very stubborn. I don't give up easily. I also don't like conflict. So, I'm the perfect person to work in collections. I also have a very dry sense of humor, which helps.~~Twenty years ago, I worked as a call agent for the phone company with the big magenta T. When a customer didn't pay his bill for a longer period, the transaction went to a collection company. Normally, the customer called us, and we explained, that he had to wait, until the collection company contacted him. Most of the customers got it. But a few threw a fit.~~I used to work for a British debt collection company, calling people about unpaid credit cards and things. It was quite frankly the worst job I've ever had, and gave me a real glimpse into how dark and horrible people could be. This story is a little lighter. Just another shift, and I had an inbound call.

RBS is the last major bank to do so, as Barclays, HSBC and Santander have already ceased the controversial practice. The move comes after an RBS employee, Samir Shah, told a parliamentary committee that RBS used ""systematic"" and ""deliberate"" strategies to maximise revenue from customers who were already in debt. Shah also revealed that RBS staff were under pressure to meet ""unrealistic"" targets for selling products to customers. After the hearing, RBS announced that it would stop selling high-interest loans to people who could not afford to repay them. However, it will continue to sell high-interest loans to people who can afford to repay them.~~So I work in a bank and my job is to call people who are late on their payments and try to set up a payment plan to bring the account current. I had a guy who was 30 days past due with no income and I couldn't offer him the covid relief program anymore because he was past due.

The number of people in debt in the UK is rising and with it the number of debt collection agencies. Last year the sector turned over £2.5bn, up 22% on the previous year. According to the Credit Services Association, which represents the debt collection industry, its members expect the number of people in debt to continue to rise over the next year. One reason for this is that the cost of living is increasing while at the same time wages are falling and unemployment is rising. More people are falling behind on their payments and finding themselves in debt.~~I have some debt that I will be speaking to a debt collector about.

He got so many calls about it, that it became a theme and in Christmas time, he was told he ruined 5 kids Christmas' because of it.~~c(ustomer) ordered a \*type of guitar\* and the gig bag that came with it did not fit. c(ustomer) wants us to pay the return shipping. we cannot offer to pay the return shipping as this is an item preference return. if c(ustomer) has a store close to him, he is welcome to return the product there as well without having to purchase return shipping. we cannot screen orders for mistakes. if c(ustomer) calls in for his next order we would be happy to make sure the items are compatible though.~~A woman called an energy company's call centre.

Yesterday, a lady was threatening to get the law involved since we had ""made an unauthorized payment with her card"". I knew that wasn't the case, so I checked her reservation and found out she had made the reservation with a fixed monthly payment plan. I suggested that she reach out to her bank. I didn't hear back from her.~~This story is from a few years ago when I worked for a mobile provider. I worked in a team that monitored customers who spent an especially large amount of money on their phone contracts or payasyougo cards with us and we would occasionally call them or text them with little gifts or incentives or offer special contracts to payasyougo customers. One day, our team picked up something strange. This one gentleman, in his early 60s, had 5 cards with us. One with a contract he was using and 4 payasyougo cards that haven't been used since he activated them but were being topped up with enormous sums of money on a pretty much weekly basis. By then, the cards each had thousands of pounds on them but absolutely no calls or any other activity. I was asked to call the customer one day and inquire as to whether or not he would like a contract for those cards and perhaps find out why there is such an insane amount of money on them despite the lack of use. He proudly explained to me that his brilliant idea was to use the 4 payasyougo cards as savings accounts for his 4 grandkids.~~Me: Hi. How can I help you? El: I'm very angry. Me: Oh? Why? El: I got a $500 ticket for expired plates. Me: I'm sorry, but our parking lot is public.

Due to different province laws, they apply the ticket price of our province. I would recommend contesting the ticket.~~Rentahobbit wants to open a bank account.

We were in competition with level 2 team and other teams to get the best average handle times etc. Henry was a customer who called in repeatedly with a problem we couldn't solve. He refused to be referred to another company, so we had to let him vent. He eventually got more and more tired and quit calling. The next day our team manager brought in a huge bag of ""O'Henry"" candy bars for the whole team. Henry's shenanigans had brought our team into first place of average handle time.~~I work in a call center. I'm currently working from home. I take calls from people who have issues with the company I work for. Most of the time, I can resolve these issues. Sometimes people are difficult to deal with. Today was one of those days. I had a caller who would not stop talking. He had so many issues with the company. I tried to help him, but he would not listen. He kept going on and on about different things. I was trying to end the conversation, but he would not let me. So I did the only thing I could do. I turned off my computer and left the call.~~I work in city council. We deal with anything public service wise. This lady called wanting to know how much she owes in tax for the year. After I checked her payment history, it was actually great. She pays on time every year the full amount. But she was charged more than she owed last year. It was some sort of processing fee. I told her there is a 0.75% transaction fee when you use certain credit cards or payment methods. It's a courtesy on our end telling people because only some transactions have it.~~A customer calls the call center to set up a payment plan for a recent balance.

I work for a large hotel chain and handle bookings, complaints, account maintenance, etc. It's been a rough time to be in the field. Due to an influx of people looking to book ""vacations"", our call centers have been dealing with back to back calls since earlier this year. It went from 0 to full speed. Wait times have applied to the dismay of our callers. I do explain why, but it's like people feel they're the only people calling in. The amount of people calling to book travel has taken it's toll on me. Seeing the news and cases rising etc isn't helping. It's disturbing how many people are traveling for leisure and then are upset when things do not go well at the hotels.~~Quitting a job is a big deal. It can be a huge relief.

After 30 minutes of the woman trying to help him, he became increasingly abusive, calling her a ""Christian liar"" and a ""cheater"". When the woman revealed that she was in fact an atheist, the man's tirade became even more vitriolic. ""You are faithless and you should be ashamed of yourself,"" he told her. ""If you knew how I feel about people like you, you would be shaking."" The woman's supervisor eventually took the call and the man was transferred to another department.~~I work in a call centre. We don't record calls, nor do we have call time limits, or scripts. If we really don't feel up to talking to customers on a given day, our boss doesn't care unless our queue is super high. We can answer customer service emails in our own way, as long as they are professional. I've had some great interactions with customers, but as for the bad ones, we simply don't have to help them. If they call and start screaming, we give them one chance to calm down and we can hang up. We have a no abuse policy, so under no circumstances would our boss force us to talk to someone who makes us uncomfortable.~~I work for a company where people open up their homes for travellers to stay in. Sometimes we have property managers who have multiple places for people to stay in. This was such a case. A guest had to cancel and they didn't agree to the refund and were never contacted regarding offering a refund and do not under any circumstances agree to the refund. This was for a trip worth $10000. The guest had an extenuating circumstance as she was diagnosed with cancer and had to be put into care as she was so unwell. and most likely having to live out the remaining days of her life here. Judging by the amount of additional guests, I have reason to believe this vacation was one last party to celebrate her life. I kindly let the company know that as this is an extenuating circumstance that we cannot offer credit to match the cancellation as documentation was provided. Their reply just made me really upset and lose faith in people and companies in general.~~I work in a call center. It's my first job and I love it. I work for a big company and I take orders and preform service. I'm not on the phone often because I primarily answer emails. But there are just some things that baffle me. 1. I had to explain to a customer 3 times in 3 different ways that his package isn't going to be delivered by UPS but by USPS because of the shipping method he chose. 2. A lady was so condescending over me having to put her on hold to find a credit we put on her card. It was a price adjustment. Like calm down you called in a week ago and asked for it. 3. People pick 6-8 business days and expect their package to ship the same day. Uh no sorry that's not how that works. 4. People pick the wrong size while ordering on the phone. We verify the sizes and colors 3 or 4 times before we place the order. It wasn't our fault. 5. People who try to return a t-shirt they bought 5+ years ago because it now has a hole.

Our customer service reps are complaining about the customers and their stupidity. But I think it's more about them not being able to handle new tasks or understand how a program works.

The people on the line I have to deal with are complete morons. I really wish I could just smash the monitor screen in with their face, then maybe they could wake up and smell the idiocy.

The customer calls to cancel the subscription and return the product for a refund. The cancellation part was smooth. The return was giving her trouble. I could hear the customer getting frustrated. She dodged the issue for a few minutes until the customer became irate and started screaming. Then she blurted out the stupidest, most unprofessional explanation I have ever heard. She said, ""The reason the returns facility does not accept opened product back is because terrorists send packages of open pills to America with bombs in them and stuff!"" The customer went silent but did not question it. It seemed as though he had no idea what to think about this. He could not return his opened diet pills because of terrorists? What ludicrous bullshit is that?~~A call centre worker has shared the hilarious moment a customer flew into a rage over having to wait five days for a technician to fix her internet. The unidentified woman screamed and shouted at the call centre worker, who remained calm and professional throughout.

16.0,"I work in tech support. A customer forgot her password and her 7-year-old jurassic phone is security locked. We can't reset the password because she forgot which email provider was used as the rescue email and on top of that the email was never verified years ago when she first assigned it as rescue email. So I offer another workaround which is to submit proof of purchase so we can remove the lock on the phone for use, but it will not recover access to device data or account id. She insults our company and processes and claims they love competitor company so much because everything is easy with them, so maybe they should boycott our products and services and switch to competitor. My only response is a cold, Okay. Do you need help with anything else?~~Me: Hi there, customer. Thank you for chatting in with *retailer*. How can I help you today? Customer: I can't seem to find the plant that I want. I don't know if you guys have it. Me: Would you like to tell me more about what you're looking for? Customer: I want roses. Me: Okay... what type of roses are you wanting? Customer: Damask roses. Me: I would be happy to assist you with your search, customer, but I will need more information. I am sure that we have roses, but I need to know what you are wanting exactly.~~Customer: Is there any dealership that sells parts in India? Me: I apologize, I cannot assist you with other dealerships, only *store name*. Customer: To whom should I contact to know more about dealerships in India? Me: I cannot assist you with other dealerships or advise you on other dealerships. Customer: How to connect with dealerships in India? Me: I cannot assist you with other dealerships.~~Does anyone else feel like they're talking to a wall when chatting with a customer? Like when they chat in stating what they want, and when you get the chat you ask for their name, but all they do is copy and paste their question? Or when you ask for their phone number but they give you the sales ticket number? The whole reason we ask for the phone number is because they usually provide the wrong sales number and we figure they'll at least be able to get their phone number right. I also like the ones who i have to repeat things for, as if scrolling up is not an option. I've quite literally had customers say ""can you repeat that?"" Or my personal favorite, when they're not responding and you ask if they're still there, and they reply yes but still don't answer the question. Actually that's not my favorite, come to think of it. My favorite is when they have a question about a delivery or service appointment but don't want to provide their home address. Very often they'll say it's because they're not comfortable sharing that information in the chat format. If you don't trust chat, don't use it!~~I work in a call center. Yesterday I had a chat with a customer that was being difficult. She was asking for a refund on her shipping, but I couldn't process the refund until she verified her order. She didn't want to verify the order. She kept saying that it was discrimination and I just didn't want to refund her shipping. I tried to explain that we need to verify the order to protect her privacy, but she didn't want to listen. She ended up calling in and cussing out my manager. My manager tried to fight fire with fire, but it didn't work.~~cx demands a replacement for a faulty laptop charger ASAP. I offer him several replacement options, and he doesn't like any of them. He is also not happy with the fact that repair stores are closed due to the lockdown. He wants to speak to my supervisor.

Customer: I think I'm going to phone in. I'm not happy with the online service. Me: The phone number is... Have a great day.~~I work at a call/chat center for an internet provider. I got a call one day and noticed the customer's name was in our system. I won't say who, though you may guess, but she was one of the David Dobrik members and is recently an OnlyFans star. I thought it may be a coincidence but the location matched up to the real life lady. Never liked her though even when I unfortunately used to watch him and his crew a while ago.~~I had a lady enter my chat queue with a software issue for her tablet. I asked for the serial number for proper filing and guidance and her response was, ""I do not trust you with that information. From which country are you chatting?"" I was still wrapping my head around her stupidity when they sent another message, ""Bye. Love you, honey!"" and closed the chat session. What does my country have to do with anything anyway? I'd have most likely disconnected on them should they say they don't trust me because of my country (I love this rule lol, no more discussions, if they're racist or something, we end chat right away!). This happened in 6 minutes total and I was like, ""WTF just happened?~~I work in a call center but I am a chat agent. The current contract I am working with only offers chat and email support. The company is going out of business and really just wants us to tie up loose ends. We are a third party call center. Anyway, at least once a day I am asked to talk to a real person. We all get this, we just say we only have chat for real-time help, and then something snippy about being real people.~~So I work in a call center. For 99% of chats we interact with the customer as a normal human being, but there are one or two clients who do not want you to speak to the customer as all. They request that a message along the lines of ""all of the customer service specialists are busy at this time, please leave an email or phone number and a member of our team will get back to you as soon as they are available."" is sent to the customer and nothing else. It's important to note as well that if you don't follow instructions like these you will get a autofail on the chat.~~Customer wants to have a feature added to her account for free, although she declined the offer some time ago. The customer support agent explains that the offer is no longer valid. The customer gets angry and starts ranting.

Me: I do apologise if you were speaking to one of my colleagues, we would never close a chat without informing you first although chats can close if there is a connection issue. Og: My game doesn't work!! Me: Ok. What part of the game isn't working? Og: My DLC for <game name> Me: Thank you for clarifying. Did you buy the DLC from us or from the console store? Og: This is an XBox not a PlayStation. Me: Sorry, when I say console store, I meant did you purchase the DLC from a website or on the actual console? Og: This is too much hassle. Why don't you just let me play my DLC. Me: I need you to log on to this website, using your console username and password, and let me know when you've done that. Og: No, I'm not going on that website. It might have a virus. Can I do this on my console?~~Karen wants to make some type of arrangement on her past due internet balance. Me looks up the account and shows a total due of 327.55 and scheduled for disconnect today. Karen doesn't get paid again until the 25th, so she will pay on the 25th with her equipment. Me submits the request for an extension, but it gets denied. Karen will terminate her service due to poor reception and horrible customer service.~~So I work in customer service. The center I work in handles almost every aspect of the business via phone, live chat and email. I normally do live chats (2 at once) but one night three weeks ago we experienced a spike in call volumes and I was moved onto the phones. I've taken a lot of calls and chats from differently normal people, but this one was slightly over the top.~~I work for a large online retailer doing chat support customer service. the company is quite well known for being very cool to deal with and usually quite liberal and generous with refunds and replacements. we are constantly being told to ""treat the customer as a friend"" and our performance is based on the customer's response to a survey we send. lately in the chat department, we have been having a lot of issues with international customers pretending they've received empty boxes, throwing fits over $0.36 price drops outside the window, etc. it's been rough. we have been getting slammed with negative responses and a lot of people are close to being fired.~~I work in customer support. I really enjoy my job for the most part. However, sometimes we get people that come in and just spew nonsense and it honestly makes me want to break my keyboard.~~A few years ago I worked in a job that is a mix of tech support and customer service. we provide both phone and chat support to our clients. My company is very customer-focused and they allow us to make small talk with the client as long as it doesn't take us away from helping them, or other clients, and not to be excessive. This happened a few years ago, so I don't remember the exact details of why the client contacted us, but I know it was a fairly complicated issue that included the use of screen sharing and I had to get our lead support rep involved as well as a developer to fix his issue. This was handled through our chat support line and as the client was in India, and speaking Hindi, I was using our chat's translate feature to communicate with the client.~~I worked as a chat agent for a very large, famous tax software. we did both chat and phone support, and i was lucky enough to become one of the chat agents. One day I was helping this guy download and install his software onto his mac, and I had asked him a question. Me: How's that download coming? Customer: Black transsexuals. Me: Excuse me? There was a long pause, followed by the customer is typing memo that popped up and disappeared several times, before receiving: Oops. Wrong window.

16.0,"A Telco worker shares an experience of how a seemingly negative situation was turned around with a bit of humour and excellent customer service. The worker explains that when a contract or offer ends, the Telco sends out an automated email with generic wording. The problem is, the email gives no indication of what the orders were specifically, which causes confusion for customers and results in many of them contacting the call centre. In this instance, the worker explained to the customer that the email was in fact a confirmation of the removal of a bonus data bolt-on that had expired. Once the customer understood what the email was regarding, they were satisfied.~~I work in customer support. We have a program where current customers can refer their friends and it benefits the newbie and the current customer. The other day I had a lady chat in about her code. I looked at it and saw it wasn't active yet, as she was still waiting on her product and service to start. Her friend wanted to buy X now and didn't want to wait. Nothing I could do for her.~~A chat support worker for an energy company shares a frustrating exchange with a customer. The customer has moved and needs to update her account. The support worker cannot make the changes herself, but will send the details to the home moves department. It can take up to 8 weeks to receive the final bill. The customer is not happy.~~I work in a call center where I take chats and email for a UK based company that provides TV services. Since we are an online TV service we do not have a phone number except for disabled people. We have a special accessibility team in place for them. There was a situation with a customer where he needed to close his accounts but did not want to use live chat or email. I explained to him that the number he might have called before is for our broadband team since we do not have a number for the TV team. I also let him know that there are other forms of disability than wheelchair.~~I work for a paging service. We ask customers for their message, type it out and send it as a text. I love it, predominantly for the sheer lack of customer interaction involved. Most days are great, but occasionally the idiots come out to play. I had a ridiculous one the other day where this guy was being extremely uncooperative about actually giving me his message. I finally managed to get what I thought was the full thing. Me: So the message reads ""pls ph obnoxious guy re: being obnoxious, and your phone number which is 123456789"". Obnoxious guy (og): Don't you dare! I haven't finished yet! Me: I'm sorry sir, you were silent, so I assumed the message was finished and already sent it. Obnoxious guy (og): Well, unsend it! This is unacceptable! Me: Sir, I can't unsend it. It's a text message. Would you like me to send a new message with all the details at no cost to you? Obnoxious guy (og): How dare you suggest that! That is not good enough. I can't believe your incompetence.~~I was trying to get customer support to complete an action on my account. They asked me to confirm my account. I was signed into my account.

The customer needed 3 of our xyzs for her daughter's birthday on Sunday. We couldn't guarantee overnight delivery. Our soonest delivery would be Tuesday. The customer couldn't afford that.

I left the chat, because I didn't want to talk to him anymore.~~I work in customer support. For security purposes we need to ask for the email once the chat starts. This customer didn't provide an actual email address in the survey he filled out before our chat. It was a random combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. When I asked the customer to verify his email, he goes absolutely crazy on me. Why do you need my email?, you're wasting my time, etc. He finally gave me his email address, followed with you're getting sued for wasting my time from 9:07 a.m. through 9:14 a.m. Goodbye and he proceeds to disconnect the chat.~~A transcript of a web chat with an energy company.

cx: i did but it says it doesn't have my name linked to my email address and that's the only email i use.

When it's busy, I help out the customer service advisors. Today was one of those days. I was only on chat, and mostly people were asking simple questions. Then I got this chap. He was angry. His app had crashed 4 times. I tried to help, but he didn't want to cooperate. He then left the chat, and didn't come back.~~c is angry because her package has not arrived on time. It's supposed to be in the wrong post office. m offers her a $15 refund as a courtesy for the issues. c is not happy and wants to speak to m's manager.~~I work on the text/chat help at my company. The way it works is you send a message on the website and we respond in a text message. I got a message asking for more info about us so I responded with my usual hello, how can I help spiel. No response which isn't new. About 15 minutes later I get a message back asking who this is. I explain who my company is and if they need any help. They then ask if I am who I really say I am and if this is just a scam. I explain again that I am with the company and they reached out to us. They respond with asking me to prove it. I still don't know what happened there.~~I work at a facility where people can contact us by phone, email or chat 24 hours a day. The amount of customers who choose the wrong option, or abandon any logical thought when contacting us, is amazing!

I look up the order by customer's email address, find out it already shipped. ""So sorry, Jane, it's too late"". If you had called us instead of emailing, maybe we had a chance. 2 - Chat on Friday night ""When is my order shipping?"" I can check that for you. Do you have your order number? ""Well, I'm about to enter my credit card information, so I don't have that yet"". Have you chosen a shipping method yet? ""Oh, what are my choices?"". If you don't know your order number, how can we look up your order? 3 - Phone call on Sunday morning ""You jerks totally screwed up my event. I never got the tablecloth for mother's day!"".

He told me about a customer who has been consistently contacting them every week since 2016 with the most trivial and bizarre questions. The guy apparently uses every single app, technology, device, and service that they have in every possible way, often not the way it should be used. He shares his account with other people, which is against the rules, and then wants their help to sort out what's his and what's theirs. He also asks questions that can be easily googled. My friend and his colleagues have tried their best to help this guy but he is extremely difficult to work with.~~A TV company employee was having trouble resetting her password.

I am curious to know how other people who handle 3 types of support (phone, live chat, email) handle the multi-tasking. Is your shift structured so that you mostly handle live chat with occasional phone calls and emails? Or is it really scrambling between the three modes? Also, what kind of metrics does your management focus on with this type of 3-tiered support job?~~John Doe wants to add his son John Doe Junior as an authorized user to his account. Customer Rep changes the way John Doe receives information summaries about modifications on his account. John Doe Junior is now authorized to deal with the account. John Doe will let his son know in the evening.~~I work as a chat agent for a payroll company. I am suppose to generate sales but I end up doing customer service. Mostly because people are too stupid to understand that everything that is put into their account is by their own company and not the company that processes the information. Today I had someone come into the chat wanting to log in because their company just hired my company to do their payroll. Here is a simplified transcript.~~I work in a call center. Our center has phone support and chat im support. Chat support was assigned to one person until 3:30pm ever day. And then m-th fom 3:30pm-6pm (chats close at 6) to one person, and then f during this time to another person. I work 10:30-7 so I was disappointed I was not included in this schedule. Generally speaking, chats are slower and less stressful than constantly be on the phones. So getting paid less and doing more work doesn't fly with me. In a meeting with a supervisor last week I mentioned I would like to have at least one day with some chat time. So she took the person who does chats on Fridays and put her on Wednesdays. And then gave me chats from 3:30-6 on Tuesdays and Fridays. Leaving the guy who had it four days a week with only two days.~~I work for a paging service. We ask customers for their message, type it out and send it as a text. I love it, predominantly for the sheer lack of customer interaction involved. Most days are great, but occasionally the idiots come out to play. I had a ridiculous one the other day where this guy was being extremely uncooperative about actually giving me his message. I finally managed to get what I thought was the full message. Me: So the message reads ""pls ph obnoxious guy re: being obnoxious, and your phone number which is 123456789"". Obnoxious guy (og): Don't you dare! I haven't finished yet! Me: I'm sorry sir, you were silent, so I assumed the message was finished and already sent it. Obnoxious guy (og): Well, unsend it! This is unacceptable! Me: Sir, I can't unsend it - it's a text message. Would you like me to send a new message with all the details at no cost to you?og: How dare you suggest that! That is not good enough.~~Live chat is the channel of choice for many customers, but how can companies make the most of this opportunity? A well-designed chat window that pops up quickly is essential, but so too is a professional and helpful chat agent. Live chat is like any conversation, so it is important to write complete sentences with proper spelling and grammar. Timeliness is also crucial, with an average response rate of 30 seconds at the most. Live chat is an excellent opportunity to use analytics to gain insight into customer behaviour. This can help companies prioritise the use of live chat on their most popular webpages and use skill-based routing to direct live chat to the most qualified agents.","Can We Stop Throwing Discounts at Customers!~~Man has been contacting since 2016 about 1-3 times per week.~~Refused to give me any information~~Customer cares not if phone explodes~~Robosales~~I am not a bot.~~No information just demands for instant magic~~Fun times with Chat Support~~I just need to vent~~O...kay?~~Phone monkey considering applying for chat support, are there downsides I can't think of?~~The page you are on~~Interesting webchat I just got...~~Customer should be allowed to swear~~I don’t want another browser~~Live Chat Horror Stories - We're about to roll out Live Chat....~~Racist A-Hole Won't Stop Calling!~~Let's hear from agents whose jobs are to handle phone, live chat and email support in the same position.~~""Introduction to Manhood""~~Small rant about chatting with people.~~Chat support vs. Phone support.

He gives me his dates and details. We get to the email address, and the following conversation ensues. Customer will be customer, I will be me.~~I was trying to book a flight from SFO to Vancouver, then on to Toronto. The first airline was great, $50 per bag, no matter the weight, size, or how many. The second airline had a weight limit of 50lbs in Toronto. The customer service agent for the second airline couldn't tell me about other airlines. I ended up cancelling the reservation and getting a flight with a different airline.~~A travel agent has shared the awkward moment a customer accused him of age discrimination. The woman, who was travelling with her daughter, wanted to move her holiday. The travel agent explained that if she moved the holiday it would come under the normal terms and conditions of the booking. He was going to put her on hold to speak to a supervisor about waiving the transfer fee. Before he had a chance to do so, the woman moved away from the phone and started talking to her daughter. The travel agent could hear the whole conversation. The woman accused him of having a bad attitude and not wanting to help her. She also said he was discriminating against her because she was older.~~Working as an airport information assistant is not as easy as it sounds. Especially when the majority of the passengers are drunk. Or high. Or just idiots. Here are some of the funniest conversations I had at work. Enjoy! Or not.~~I work for an airline, in the loyalty department. We get calls from people who want to use their points to get flights for a very low price. I'm the only one who can speak and write in French fluently, so all the French calls are redirected to me. I got a call from an old man who wanted to get a flight from here to there, so he could marry his fiance. He told me his life story. I was looking up for a flight for him, but there was no flight available, so I decided to break a lot of rules of our call center. I asked the old man if I could keep his private mail address and keep him up to date on availabilities. He agreed to my plan and we kept talking every now and then. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a flight for him, so he ended up buying with another airline. But I don't regret the time I spent trying to help someone so nice.~~I worked in the call center division of a major airline for 36 years. on the phones as an agent or supervisor for 18 or so of those years. almost all airlines have usually three levels to their frequent flyer programs.~~My friend who works in a call center for an airline company hung up on someone for the first time today. c called to refund a ticket. f explained that it was not possible but c did not believe her. f put c on hold but c kept shouting. f eventually hung up on him.~~A guy calls in and asks if he can bring a coffin on a city bus. Seeing as how this was a question that has almost certainly never been asked in the history of the human race it wasn't an eventuality anyone ever prepared for so there exists no regulation against it. As long as it doesn't block the aisle or take up a seat...you can bring a coffin on a bus. I have a feeling there's going to be a new rule.~~I worked in an airline call center for 30 years. I try to repress most of those memories because most of those years were spent in the complaint dept. Even the last 10 years working from home could not soften the daily assault on my brain. I had a customer who needed to buy a ticket to a family wedding. The convo started off badly when I asked where she was leaving from and she said ""here"". Going to which airport? ""I don't remember but it's in *tatertown*!"" I checked her frequent flyer account...no info. After googling and exhaustive research I gave up. I could not locate *tatertown*.

The problem has become so widespread that some airlines have started to request documentation to prove the animal is a support animal, and not a pet. One airline employee posted a recording of a conversation with a passenger who was attempting to bring a pet on board. The exchange quickly turned heated, as the passenger became increasingly agitated at having to pay a fee, and the airline employee repeatedly requested documentation. At one point the passenger claimed the animal was a support animal, however, the airline employee explained that in order for the animal to qualify as such, the passenger would need to send in documentation ahead of time, as per the airline's policy. The passenger eventually hung up.~~Me-m guy-g. M- hello this is exteriorpain how can i assist with your existing reservation? G- yeah! My ticket has me going to the wrong place. M- No problem!

Why are you making me go all the way to Chicago then back to DC? M- *Ice breaker laugh* No sir! We actually have you connecting through Charlotte. G- Yeah thats what I asked for why is it showing Chicago on the website? M- Sorry about that one, I have no idea what you may be looking at, however for your flight you are indeed connecting through Charlotte.~~airline guy, i got another story...so when you work frontline the best calls are from passengers who know exactly what they want. get them on, get them off, they know how everything works it's a win/win. so naturally when a passenger wants to book a flight and they already have the flight numbers it means they already know the flight times and it makes less verbiage on the call for you. so a lady calls in, gives me the cities and dates and tells me the flight numbers. when i'm recapping the flights for her i give her the big once over so we are on the same page. &gt; m- so, just to confirm we have you leaving out of seattle at 745am flight xx going to honolulu via los angeles arriving at 10pm &gt; l- yes that's right &gt; m- so, just to confirm we have you leaving out of seattle at 745am flight xx going to honolulu via los angeles arriving at 10pm &gt; l- yes that's right &gt; m- &gt; l- wait a minute, how long is my connection? &gt;~~A festivalgoer called into her bank to understand why her payment for festival tickets was declined even though she had enough money in her account. The bank employee explained that there were two transactions, one for the plane ticket and one for the festival. The festivalgoer did not understand and asked to speak to a supervisor.~~Flight cancellations are the worst. Delaying a flight is pretty terrible too. But this guy takes the cake. He won't respond to the airline representative, so she disconnects the call. Then he calls back. She disconnects again. Then he shows up at the airport.~~I used to work taking calls for the airport. A lady called at 10pm because her daughter's flight has been delayed and she is supposed to attend a medical convention early next morning in another city, so she absolutely can't lose this flight!!! Vueling is pretty bad with late night delays. A late night delay more often than not means the flight is cancelled. The airport and the airlines that operate within it are in fact completely different companies. And a lot of people straight up didn't understand that.

So of course he insists on going but decides to bombard me with questions: What happens if my flight is cancelled? When will it be cancelled? So my flight is cancelled? No sir, however if you wish to cancel you can call back to rebook when it's convenient for you. This is ridiculous ill just callback later when you guys figure it out.~~I work on an airline call centre. A guy called to upgrade his seat. His flight was tomorrow, so it took some time to confirm. He was shouting ""Hello?!"" every 4-5 seconds. I asked him to hold on, but he was getting on my nerves, so I upgraded his seat, even though I hadn't confirmed everything yet.~~I work for an airline. Our system prevents fraud, scams, etc. by not allowing duplicate bookings. So no, you can't put 10 flights on hold for 10 flights leaving out of the same city on the same day. The computer will, and at no discretion immediately cancel out what you booked.

The law has been welcomed by passenger advocacy groups. However, some airlines are concerned that the law could open the floodgates to claims from passengers who are merely looking for a free flight. Ryanair has already changed its terms and conditions in order to shorten the time limit for claiming compensation. easyJet, meanwhile, has called for the law to be changed so that claims can be processed through the airline, rather than via a claims management company.~~Impatient Jane wants a refund for her canceled flight.

The airline's main language was not English, and I was in the bilingual department, so I received very few calls per day. The call came in around noon, and it seemed pretty normal at the beginning: a guy called to quote various flights. After he asks for the third or fourth flight, there is a reverberating sound from his side of the line and he asks me if I could hold for a couple of minutes. It seemed like he placed the phone somewhere, and then I started to hear slightly breathing noises, for about 2 or 3 minutes, then silence. I asked if he was still there, and like if he was far away from the phone I hear something like ""Yeah, please give me two more minutes"". Rule was to wait up to 5 minutes and then hung up if the user was unresponsive, but I really thought he was going to buy at least one flight, so I waited. A couple minutes after he comes back, reverberating sound still on, he sounds tired and says ""Thank you, x, you've been amazing. I'll check other options and call you back later"", and hungs up.~~c's internet isn't working. m discovers it's because c's activation date is next week. c has waited 2,5 weeks. m's friend had a problem with his suitcase when he flew from Denmark to Barcelona. c thinks it's unacceptable and hangs up.~~This is a story about a man who tried to pull a fast one on an airline agent.

The agent then helped him book the flight at the original price.~~I worked for a major hotel chain at the time of the 9/11 attacks. We gave discounts to airline employees. This story is 100% true.    On the morning of September 11, 2001, I took a phone call from a man who claimed to be an airline pilot. He was distraught, and I'll never forget his words.    ""I'm so sorry.

I let her know the bank will contact us and we will explain our company policy.~~Hiya! airline guy, so in the airline industry we have a concept called ""reprotecting"" which means if a flight is delayed or cancelled and its not weather related, we can sometimes call another airline that we have a contractual agreement with if they have flights to the same origin and destinations. It's not something we like to do, because it's basically asking another airline to help us out. So lets say airline A cancelled their flights and have nothing else that day. airline A can book flights using airline B's aircraft and schedule but they have to confirm with airline B because if not you're basically putting a flight on hold that hasn't been paid for. The other airline can and will deny the passenger and it's really a nightmare for them, but it's nothing we would be able to do.~~airline guy...

lady calls in, wants to book a flight for two from a to b. evidently she saw there were seats available and called backed to book. there's no more seats now that she's calling back, i tell her unfortunately the flight she had her sights on is booked she may want to try something else at a different time.

&gt; m-**breaks the news**

&gt; l- ""but there was one seat available earlier today""

i really have a pet peeve about explaining availability to passengers. if there was a seat available when you checked, what compels a person to think that seat couldn't possibly be booked by someone else if they choose to make a decision at a later time? why didn't you just put the reservation on a hold? why didn't you buy it when you had the chance if you ""just saw it"" an hour ago??????????????

Well, the only problem is the tickets the guy was finding were too expensive for the date and time he wanted to travel. Sidenote: For those of you who don't know, the price of a seat on a flight depends on the inventory available, so based on how many seats are left on a particular flight it may be more or less expensive at a different time. More seats = less expensive. Closer to the day of departure = less seats = higher price. Whatever.~~I've been in the top tier of my favourite airline's frequent flier programme for the last ten years. I try to be nice to the airline staff. I was on the phone with a man named Bill.

Fempax hangs up.~~A few years back I was working for the frequent flyers program for one of Australia's larger airlines. We got calls all the time from people who wanted compensation for all sorts of things. Most of the time it was for things that were clearly outside of our control (delayed flights, lost bags, etc). But occasionally we'd get someone who was just looking for a fight. This was one of those times.~~I work in the airline industry.

well apperantly it isn't simple for some people. because in some cases i get that annoying customer that starts to ask me why i ask for phone number and email address and gets very defensive over that, asking why these questions are even a thing and start an argument and and rant about how unnecessary that is despite being in a hurry and despite being capable of saying ""no, thank you"". 

like, isn't f*cking obvious that my company just decided that those questions must be asked and that they're part of the protocol that they decided? isn't obvious that this is contact information just in case we need to contact them? they should understand that, since they're literarlly workers from airlines, following the rules of their company.~~So I work in customer service for an online travel agency. We don't actually sell flights, but we service them (itinerary irregularities, flight change requests, cancellations, etc). For pretty much any major airline in the Americas, there's a fee to willingly make a change to your ticket (anywhere from $50-300 for domestic), and if the flight you want to change to costs more than your original, you pay the difference.

client 1: okay but what about my seat selection fees? i paid $200 for seat selection. 

me: the refund is for the value of your tickets only, $6000 total. it does not include refund service fees and add-on.

Then she wanted me to make the exact same booking for her, but the same booking class wasn't available and her price was slightly higher.

I know he couldn't really help me, but that kindness I was shown is still something to this day I remember.~~I work for the red white and blue airline in reservations and had a clearly elderly man call in asking where a flight was landing at ohare the next day from lax. gives me her seat number, itinerary, time, everything but what I need. I ask for a flight number. I get a flight from Japan to NYC. I tell him I can't use that number as it's not accurate, does he have a confirmation code? Starts babbling off something that's not a locator for our airline. I explain without this information I can't help and will need to disconnect. Ten minutes he yells at me about this and I'm wrong and how should he find out where it lands? I suggest calling her and get a rant about texting. I finally explained I couldn't help him and would have to disconnect and did. My buddy next to me felt so bad for me.~~This is a transcript of a recorded call. Names and other identifying information have been removed. Hi, it's me airline guy. So we have things called ""travel notices"" and what that basically means is we are giving customers the options to change flights without penalty. They happen for lots of reasons but the most common are weather and airport incidents. Well, over the summer the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a bulletin stating that pregnant women traveling to specific countries were at risk for the Zika virus. And that in turn made us issue a travel notice offering refunds to passengers that may be affected by that bulletin.~~Call centres get a bad press, and some of it is deserved. But sometimes the public can be beyond help. I worked in one many years ago. A woman phoned to book train tickets. After I gave her a price she said she could fly for half the price. I pointed out the advantages of train travel. She wasn't having any of it. She was going to fly.~~Not sure if this is appropriate here, but I'll give it a shot. I work in an industry where I talk to people over the phone all day long. Part of my job is to get people excited about the vacations that they are planning. I have a knack for remembering little details about people's lives. I can usually remember names of people's grandchildren, the name of their dog, and where they went on their last vacation. I have had countless people tell me that they have never had such a pleasant experience booking a flight (or hotel or car rental). I love my job and I love the people that I get to talk to. I am not sure if I am just really good at my job or if I am really lucky to have such a great job.~~I work for an airline. Just got a call from a guy upset that we ""lost"" his 60 year old mother that he dropped off at the airport whos from Romania, ""can't speak English"" and has no cell phone. He was calling to belittle the company, but not before he spent an entire 10 minutes bitching because I had to verify the account since he apparently was ""driving and couldn't pull over"" long enough to access up her confirmation number so I wouldn't be flagged for giving out confidential information about a passenger. I got an earful about our ""incompetence"" in ""losing"" his mother because it's our ""responsibility"" to ""guarantee"" that she make it to her flight. Pulled up her reservation, no request for special assistance, passenger not disabled…I'm stunned.~~A man wants to book a flight using his points. The system doesn't recognise his number. He is angry. The agent refuses to help him. He wants to talk to the agent's supervisor. The agent ends the call.~~So I work for an airline call center and our ticketing isnt instant for ""non urgent"" travel ie: something not within the next 2 hours. it can take generally between an hour to a few hours for the reservation transaction to ""pull"" from the customers cc. I commonly tell pax that they should receive the ticketing confirmation ""within the hour"" so they dont start bombarding me with unnecessary questions. its not uncommon for a pax to do the reservation themselves on our website and for whatever reason click submit multiple times, or go through the process so fast they dont realize that they completed it and make yet another reservation. I dont know why people dont just check their bank app to double check or call us back to verify theres a reservation on queue for ticketing but whatever. we will refund a ""double booking"" 100% of the time so its no big deal...unless...you not only make the same reservation multiple times, but you do them on multiple airline websites...~~airline guy...first things first. most airlines dont assign seats. that means when a flight is available for sale, you pick your seat when you book your flight at your leisure. that means the earlier you book, the more seating options you have available. you wouldnt ask someone to get out of their seat opening night in a packed movie theater if you wanted to sit with your boyfriend would you? same concept.~~A new call centre worker answers a call from an angry customer who wants a refund for a flight he cancelled. The customer booked the flight on the company's website and cancelled it a few days later also through the same site. The call centre worker explains that this was a low fare ticket and thus not refundable later than 24 hours after purchase. The customer screams at the worker that he is stealing his money and the call ends.~~I work for an airline. Often times passengers call in angry and upset that they haven't received an email, but their bank hasn't approved their charge so of course we haven't issued their ticket. This is an actual transcript of a call. Names have been changed to protect the innocent.~~I work for an airline. A passenger called to ask if she could carry her cat on the plane. The cat was heavier than 8 kg, so it would be carried in the cargo hold. The woman got angry and yelled at me for 30 minutes.","Nasty Nancy~~I hate this game...~~Ah, the airlines...~~Home Alone 2: Lost in RDU~~There are other ways besides deliberatly lying that you can be incorrect about something ma'am.~~JUST TAKE THE REFUND~~I HAVE AN ACCOUNT, I MATTER~~This isn't how it works....~~Happy luggage problems~~That flight is JFK to Tokyo not LA to Chicago, her seat number is useless, do you have anything that’s accurate, relevant or even helpful in any way?~~THIS IS INVASION OF MY BODY~~It's your own time you're wasting!~~I think the sweetest call I ever took~~When shifting the responsibility goes to a whole new level~~It doesn't work that way~~My credit card didnt go through did it?

The agent has no idea and suggests that the customer try a different browser.~~i work in a call center that does hr roles for larger companies. my specific role is dependent verification. as some back ground for the rest of the story. if you have dependents enrolled on your benefits your company may wish to have them verified. a company can do this at any time. typically it happens after annual enrollement.~~As I've stated in my past posts I worked for a rather large Australian airline handling frequent flyer points. Though there are a lot of negative stories and bloody funny ones too I thought I might post about some of the great customers that I had while working there. I should note that I haven't worked for this company for about 3 years so the fact that I can remember them makes them pretty special. Story 1 One of the first amazing customers I had was for a couple who where waiting in LAX for their flight back to Sydney. They had complimentary access pass to use the departure lounge but it was being refused by the lounge staff. After speaking to the customers dad and then ringing the customer on his mobile I'd worked out that the club was at fault. I told the customer to head back to the club and I would have it sorted. So I rang the lounge at LAX spoke to the person and got it sorted. (Turns out it wasn't the fault of the lounge staff or the customer some one forgot to send them an email about this offer.) About a week later I came in one morning and there was an email from the customer thanking me for the service that I provided them.~~A man of... haggling based ethnicity called in having previously bought tickets for a show. looking at his history, he had already changed the date once and, yep, that's what he was calling for now, to move it to another date. Now the mater of ticket has a strict exchange policy. Most events won't even let you exchange tickets, but the ones that do require that your new tickets cost the same or more than your old tickets, no exchanges for cheaper tickets. I explain this to the guy and let him know at least three times that it is at the master of ticket's discretion if we'll do the exchange.~~I work for a small airline's reservations department. we had to pull out of a region due to massive losses over the past few fiscal years a result of doing business there. management came up with a solution to the lost revenue stream, i.e codesharing with another airline. the problem is they really botched the implementation of the whole thing. cancelling all our flights in said region, effective june 1st and planning to set up the code share flights on the 2nd of july. cancelled flights are removed from the system near the last possible minute (5 days prior to departure). at that time, we have to call all of the passengers and let them know they've been rebooked on the other airline.",THATS NOT WHAT IM SHOWING ON THE WEBSITE~~Sun Flowers(jpeg)~~Some of the best customers I've ever had.~~No Exchange For You!~~Airline tells us to lie to customers and knowingly sell tickets for flights that won't happen,A transcript of the conversation between an American Airlines agent and a customer.

18.0,"A customer service rep. works at a smaller call centre that sells discounted electronics. They deal in either damaged goods or older models. If a customer makes an error or changes their mind, they have a no returns policy. The story concerns a lady who has accidentally bought a new $1000 bottle gas heater.~~hello, pals. i work for a local plumbing company. right now we have a promotion for a water heater flush which is essentially a way to get a plumber in your home and try to sell you a water heater... but i digress.~~I worked for an electricity company in the UK. I was on the prepayment team which always had good stories. One story always amuses me any time I think about it. A guy called in because he had no hot water and knew there was money on the meter so he figured the meter was broken. These meters tend to be under stairs in a darkened cupboard. Conversation as follows: Me: Is there a display on the meter? Customer: I can't see, it's pretty dark. There's normally a light on the meter but that's not on. Me: Ok, I just need to make sure there's no display, can you press the red button please? Customer: I can't see a red button, it's right in the corner. Hang on, let me light a match so I can see better. Now having an open flame near a gas device is never a good idea. Before I had a chance to tell him so, the phone went dead. I started panicking thinking that this guy has just killed himself and blown up his house. I asked my manager what I should do and he said try calling him back and if there's no answer call the police.~~I worked for a very well known electric car and solar energy company a few years back. one day, i had this fella call. he was all hot and bothered demanding to know why we're ""illegally"" holding his money. the money in question was a payout for his panels underproduction of energy for circumstances not forseen in his pv systems designs. at the time, we usually issued a physical check to the mailing address on record if we couldn't reach the customer within 3 calls. each call spaced 2 days apart.~~I work in a call centre. We are currently experiencing an influx of complaints. Most of them are not even valid and are just people trying it on. I had one today that has really got me riled up. I won't go into detail but it was a complaint about a vehicle finance company. The customer cancelled the agreement. They then booked an appointment to have the vehicle collected. On the day they took the day off work unpaid to wait for us. No one turned up. Then they complained. I am livid. I have had a terrible day caught up in ""office politics"" which has wiped my mental health off the board.~~So I work for a trucking company that was recently hit by a scammer. I work in the office and the scammer called, pretending to be one of our drivers. He said he was in jail and needed money to get out. The person who took the call was new and didn't think anything of it and processed the request. I found out about it the next day and immediately called the bank and had the account closed. The bank told me that the money could not be recovered and that an investigation would have to be done before the account could be reopened. I called the police and filed a report. I also called the driver to let him know what had happened. He was shocked. Apparently the scammer knew his name, his truck number, and the name of the company he works for. The police told me that they would contact the driver to get his side of the story but that since the money could not be recovered, they would not be investigating the case any further. I'm not sure what to do now. I've talked to my boss and he doesn't seem to care. He just wants the account reopened so he can get his money.~~meter cupboards are often replaced by councils and social housing providers. They lock with standard yale keys, but worryingly often they're not given to the householder. Today, a customer was unable to provide me with meter readings because he didn't have the keys. After much discussion, it emerged that he used his foot to open the cupboard.~~Customer is having building work done and needs his electric meter moving. Another company alters his service but we need to remove the meter beforehand and reinstall it afterwards. The only metering work we're doing after it all being cancelled due to COVID is installing smart meters. I called him yesterday to tell him I couldn't book the job for him but I would try and find a solution. He went off shouting, swearing, telling me I wasn't going to help him, I don't care about him, he will sue my company in general and me in particular. Whatevs, I told him I'd call him today and I hung up. Spoke to a very senior manager who said we could try to get an emergency call the morning the work was due and then another one when it was completed. Not guaranteed and not the best way of doing things but the only way to proceed atm. So I call him today to tell him and he's immensely grateful.~~I used to work as a CSR in a call center for a fairly large power company. One day I got a call from a lady who was screaming and cursing about how we charged her too much on her bill. She said we should be shut down and that it should be illegal to charge for electricity since it's in the air. I really wondered how some people make it to adulthood.~~I work in tech support for HVAC. End users are not supposed to be calling us. They call us, thinking we have some magic that can be done over the phone that they can do themselves so they don't have to spend more money. But they do. All the time. Because they get the phone number off the website and think it must be for them.~~My friend works at an electric company. Occasionally they have areas that they schedule to be turned off due to regular maintenance on the power lines and other issues they need to fix to prevent a massive outage. My friend received a call about this issue. At first the caller was pleasant but then quickly turned nasty.~~A customer called in with an escalated complaint. She was angry about the high pressure sales tactics used by one of our agents to sign her up. I explained how our company works and that the price she was given was that day's price. She didn't like it and kept repeating that I was pressuring her. I suggested that she take it up with the dictionary people. She hung up.~~A meter reader for a UK energy company has been accused of stalking a customer. The customer has reported the worker to the police and her energy supplier. She claims that the meter reader has been leaving notes on her doorstep and hanging around outside her home. The meter reader denies the allegations. Energy companies often use sub-contractors to read meters, particularly in rural areas.~~background: i work for an energy supplier that calls people off the back of surveys taken either in person or online. details include marital status, the number of people in the household etc. my screen displays: mrs karen anderson (not her real name), living with partner, 3 bedroom, 2 people, semi-detatched house. me: hi, is that karen? karen: who is it? me: its john smith calling from energy co in regards to the survey you completed. its just a call to see if we could save you money by switching. is it yourself that deals with the gas and electricity bills? karen: no, its not. me: ah, sorry my mistake. is it the other half that deals with it? would i be able to speak... karen: excuse me!? i cant believe you just said that! that is so sexist! its not the 1950s anymore! me: sorry? karen: oh my god! how can you think thats acceptable to say to a woman! what- you think im half a person!? me: no, thats something i say to everyone, men and women, you know, like my wife is my other half...~~I work in a call centre. A couple of months ago we had a complaint from a customer. They had completely misunderstood basically everything about how the UK energy market works. Fair enough, they're an immigrant. No judgement, but if you're new to the country it can be easy to miss certain practical details. Hell, a lot of native folk misconstrue a lot of this stuff. On checking the call we'd explained everything and asked them if they understood. They said they did. As per our complaint procedure, I, as a senior manager, called the customer, walked them through everything and tried to find a solution. They seemed to understand. However, two months later they emailed in complaining that we hadn't dealt with the complaint. Apparently they'd forgotten my forty-odd minute call. On calling them back, they were livid. They don't want to have a phone call, they want a *formal complaint*. I tried to explain that this is our formal complaint procedure, as stated on our website. It complies with the regulators guidelines, the ombudsman scheme, the (voluntary) industry code of practice, the individual requirements of all the suppliers, etc.~~I worked in a university department which printed a lot of stuff. We got a new colour printer. I had to install it. The installation manual warned that you must not move the printer unless it has been switched off for some hours to let the ink solidify again. I put a big notice on the printer saying not to move it unless it has been switched off for at least three hours. A few weeks later I got a ticket from the department - new printer not working. I went up there and walked to where the printer was. It wasn't there. The guy who reported the problem saw me and told me it was now at the other end of the office. You can guess the rest.~~Customer service is a tough job. We've all been on the receiving end of an unpleasant customer service call. But what if the customer is being abusive? What if the customer is using foul language? What if the customer is just being a jerk?~~Get a call from a lady around 31yo, uk based energy company where pay-as-you-go (payg) meters and standard meters are both common. nice lady (nl): i've gotten a bill for 2.5k, but i'm on a payg meter, account number on bill is blah, my name is mrs nl looking into account, it's for a miss blah at her address, account is pretty blank but that's not uncommon, just one bill for this 2.5k and a lot of mentions of defaults but this is an estimated bill. sidenote: she had called in before to a teammate and she pretty much told her to pay it and byebye me, looking at the account, it's for a miss blah at her address, account is pretty blank but that's not uncommon, just one bill for this 2.5k and a lot of mentions of defaults but this is an estimated bill.","Lady Ignores my Advice at a High Cost~~“If I get food poisoning from Wendy’s, I ain’t gonna blame it on McDonalds.”~~Have you just blown up your house?~~Customer says we're gonna pay him a late fee.~~Why haven't you collected my car?~~UPDATE: Member drives over our drivers arm and then flees the scene~~That's one way of solving the problem~~Customer complained about me~~It should be illegal to charge for Electricity!~~Stop.

I gather the usual info and as soon as I tell the guy if he's not there within the hour to give us access to the meter and inside that we may need to shut off his service at the street, he stops responding. Still on the line, can hear people in the background, he's just not answering. I hope we can't get access and shut him off at the street. If you want to fake a gas emergency, you better be prepared to deal with the consequences if you're lying.~~A UK energy company call centre received a complaint from a customer who wanted an explanation for why meter readers were still being sent out during the current lockdown. The customer had a 20-minute rant about the issue. The call centre worker who took the call had to raise a complaint on the customer's behalf, as he was unsure if the decision to keep sending meter readers out was a business one or a legal requirement. The customer also said he'd written to a local newspaper about the issue.~~A 60+ year old man called the energy company to switch through to another energy company. He was unaware that he was on a tariff due to end in February, which meant he would have to pay exit fees. The customer service agent explained to him that he had to go through to the provider he wanted to be with and sign up. They would then take over his supply. The supervisor took over the call. The customer was angry and used abusive language. The supervisor warned him three times and eventually terminated the call.~~I work for a local power company. lady called in asking if we'd received the medical necessity form for her husband. i told her we hadn't, and she started saying that she was worried about power outages. that's when i realized that she never even read the form, just had her husband and his doctor sign it.~~A call center worker who goes over an electric utility service is annoyed with some of the complaints she gets. Many customers call her to complain that their neighbor is paying less for the electricity than they are. She doesn't know what to do with such complaints. She suggests that they maybe buy more energy-efficient electrical appliances, but the customers might take that as a cue from the energy company to buy new appliances.~~Karen is upset about her gas bill. It is unusually high. DefinitelyFBIornSa tries to help her but she is not interested. She disconnected the call.~~I worked for 18 years for a major electrical utility company in a major city. we also had two walk-in offices, and all of the csr's were required to do a 2 month stint in each office. because of the number of reps we had, this only occurred about every 4 years. one of the offices was in a financially depressed part of the city made up of mostly minority people -- latino and black, and gang members often drop in. i am white.~~So I work for an out of hours repairs team. We get calls from council housed tenants who are self entitled and think the world owes them a living. 

One such call came in. Female calls in. Has called British Gas to her house as her boiler is not working. British Gas informs her that the problem is her boiler, which has a low pressure and not the gas supply. As the property belongs to the council, British Gas is not allowed to touch the boiler and they honestly don't care. 

I go through our standard questions, such as whether anyone has any Covid symptoms, and whether there are any medical requirements and any children under 6 months old. We also have to ask about back up heating and hot water. 

The caller informs me that she has no back ups for heating but has an electric shower. She also has a 1 year old in the house, no medicals/disabilities. 

As we are an out of hours service, we have to call our on call manager who says yes or no to a repair. As it's late and the caller doesn't fit into our vulnerability group, he says no. Pretty standard at 10pm on a Sunday.~~I work in a complaints team for an energy company. Our usual protocol for poor customer service is to offer a credit off their balance of £20.

The power company worker explained that they didn't keep track of their customer's skin colour and that the hurricane didn't discriminate. She hung up on him. Later that day, a white man called the power company to complain that they were prioritising the power restoration for minorities. The power company worker explained that wasn't the case. The white man hung up on him.~~A man called the power company to complain that they had shut off his power. He was angry because he had not received any warning letters. However, the address he provided was not the address where the power was disconnected. It was a second property. Therefore, he had received sufficient warning. The man continued to swear at the operator. The operator warned him that she would disconnect the call if he did not stop using profanity. The man called back several times over the next week. However, the company did not compensate him for the spoiled food.~~someone i know works at a call center here in wv, dealing with utilities customers. they related this story to me yesterday. i will retell it as best i can. please to enjoy. yesterday a gas meter repair tech headed to a call in oak hill. he spoke to a man who lived at the house, who told him that the only person home was granny. granny was half blind and half deaf and slept all day. ""she won't even know you're there, so don't bother her. i'll leave the basement doors open so you can go downstairs and repair the meter."" fair enough. the tech goes down to the basement and starts working on the meter. after several minutes, the basement bilco doors suddenly shut. he hears the latch shut, locking them. a woman's voice says ""hah hah, i got you now! i'm gonna go get me my gun!"" the tech, understandably concerned, whips out his phone to call for help. but it's oak hill. not exactly out in the boonies, but also not an actual city. down there in the basement he has no signal.~~I'm in your home warranty call center, taking your calls, and taking technician calls.

Me- 'ok, so it appears you took a meter reading between statements so the balance is off'. GOB- 'And what tariff am I on? I want you to read me the unit rates'.~~A thread on Reddit posed the question of what is the most ridiculous thing you have been asked to do at work. The responses included an angry customer demanding that a pizza be delivered to his house, because he was too lazy to go out and get one.

You know you have done nothing wrong but the ombudsman could side with the customer anyway.~~I work in a call centre. A customer was being a pain in the arse. She was rude and obnoxious and I wasn't having it. I gave her a piece of my mind. My manager listened in and gave me a formal warning for being rude to a customer. I don't think I was rude. I was assertive. There is a difference.~~Hi /r/consequencesoflying. I work in a power company call center. The nature of the job is to take calls from customers who need help with their power, gas, or water. We also take emergency calls for downed power lines, gas leaks, and the like. I've been working there for almost 3 years and have gotten some interesting stories out of it. Some funny, some sad, some that make you question humanity. I'll start with one that still haunts me to this day.~~This happened about 6 months ago when I still worked in the call centre. I worked for a large energy company and this call came through. I answered with the usual Hi you're through to _____. C: Put a manager on the phone right now! I'm so sorry they were rude to you. But I'm sorry I've only spoken about 5 words to you so how do you know I don't want to help you? I'll try to help you. (got her account number and passed security with her and she started complaining saying the amount we were charging her was ridiculous and she wanted me to calculate her usage manually based on the meter reads she had just taken, so I calculated them and told her how much it came to) C: That is wrong! Try again! M: Okay. (calculates again and gets same result) C: Stop lying to me! I know you are lying to me! M: I'm not lying to you. C: Yes you are!

I'm dreading this upcoming season.~~I just left a job where I worked for an energy company (your gas/electric provider). My responsibility was to call customers back that had failed an agent on an after call survey, and find out what I could do to make things better. I had unlimited authority to do so.   Background: In our state, we have a law that allows you to choose to 'buy' your gas from an alternate company. We still bill you, but they set your rates. Ten times out of ten, the rate the provider charges you is higher than ours. We're not allowed to make profit on gas sales by law, so naturally, our rates are always low.~~A recent [Family Feud]( surveyed 100 people for their top excuse to stop telemarketers. ""not interested"" reminded me of one call when I was on outbound sales for an electricity company. Me: Hi my name's Ray from Energy Company. Him: Not interested. Me: (Weary from the 100th no interest reply this shift) Do you even know what you're not interested in? Him: What are you calling about? Me: I'm calling about Energy Company electricity. Him: Definitely not interested. Me: That's ok. I'll have your electricity disconnected tomorrow for you. Him: Wait wait!~~A customer called in today to ask a question about a water heater. The only info he had about it was that it runs on propane and is a 50 gallon tank. He wanted to know what the btu rating was for his 50 gallon water heater. Obviously with minimal info it's not possible to answer a specific question but this guy was not ok with that. After arguing with me to just look up what the btu is for a tank this size is, even though I have no way of knowing which other models to compare his to, I heard a coworker talking about a new car he got and I realized the best analogy here.~~A woman working for an energy company explains how she deals with clients who are in need of emergency help. She talks about the precautions her company takes to protect its employees and the steps they take to provide clients with the best possible service.

He ended the call by hanging up without booking an appointment at all.~~Customer: Miss X here, thank you for answering the call.

One day I got a call from a woman who was threatening to kill herself. She wanted to talk to my manager, but he was busy, so I took the call. I talked to her for around 20 minutes, trying to calm her down. Eventually, I managed to get her to agree to not kill herself. I then transferred the call to my manager.

I can think of three times it happened to me in the two years I worked for a major cell phone company. The first time, someone called in and immediately asked to speak with my supervisor. We were supposed to do everything we could to help before escalating a call, but she was adamant she wouldn't do anything, not even give her name, to me. . .she demanded to speak only to my supervisor.

Then they will take a screenahot of the answer and circle it with bold red markings so my dumb ass can't miss it. Then they will ask what the problem is and why I didn't know that before.~~This is a story about a customer who was angry about the fact that he did not receive any updates on his repair after 8 days. He was obnoxious and rude the whole time. He kept giving me lessons and said that he knows how things work around here. Also yelled I was no help whatsoever. He got agitated the moment someone said I need to reach out to someone because for him it is passing the rope to someone else. And he kept yelling his conspiracy theory that we trying to ditch him.~~I work in sales. Whenever a customer threatens me with termination, I could swear that my voice automatically becomes sultry sweet as I provide my ""employee number"" and name. A name that we make up for security reasons and a number that would only mean anything to the right people. You cannot be fired unless the customer submits a formal complaint or you're caught being rude by quality control.

He was shouting at me for a few minutes, then he suddenly stopped. I thought that he had hung up, but he was still there, listening to me. Then he started to talk normally and asked for a supervisor. I transferred his call to my supervisor. They talked for a few minutes, then he started to shout again. He was swearing at my supervisor. Then he hung up. We dropped his phone privileges because of his behavior.~~So I work in a call centre. Part of my job is assessing finance applications. Today I had a difficult customer who wouldn't accept my decision. She asked for my manager and I advised that he would call her back on Monday. She refused and kept asking for a manager.

I took over a call from an agent as I'm acting manager for the night. The reason the man was calling was because he was unable to login to his app and was wondering where his account opening promotion was. The man was over 60. I helped him with his issue. The man was unhappy with the solution and yelled at me.~~So I work in tech support. We get all kinds of people calling in, but occasionally I get someone who is just completely unbearable to talk to. Today was one of those days. I had a customer who was clearly frustrated about having to move to the US, and took it out on me for an hour and a half before I finally just hung up on her. I know I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but I just couldn't take it anymore.~~A shoe reseller got mad at a bank because his card was blocked while trying to buy shoes to resell. He wanted the bank to give him $1000 for the failed transaction. The bank said no. The shoe reseller then yelled at the manager.~~Customer calls in.

He demands to speak to a supervisor. I look up his loan agreement and confirm, he signed a 75 month loan, not 72 months. He doesn't believe me, so I order a copy of his loan mailed out and advise him that he still needs to make those payments or he would risk being reported as delinquent.

Either hanging up if it took too long and calling back or demanding our supervisors and then asking to get put back into queue when we refused. We finally piece together from his first sup call that he is demanding an order be delivered to him today. An order he hasn't even placed yet. Like just not possible sir.

He says to me, ""no, no no, you are not listening to me! Let me tell you what happened!"" Then he tells me a very long story about the people he has been working with in our company and his billing, which is all normal and fine. (I also reached out to them over our work instant message and they said they had to call the police on him, so he is not aloud in his local branch and he is not allowed to call them.)

19.0,"Alright, my first actual post here aside from comments. this happened today, and i am still baffled. 

background: i work as a contractor for a very well known phone company. i just recently started taking escalated calls, where a customer asks to speak with a manager or supervisor. 

me: me

edb: entitled douchebag (customer)

me: thank you for calling (company), my name is (me). so from my understanding, you have some international charges and you thought you were on a plan to cover these, correct? and we're just changing you to the correct plan and rerating your bill?

edb: well, yeah, but not exactly (i roll my eyes here, as my supervisor explained what the call was about beforehand). see, i've been on the phone for over 30 minutes (nope, he was literally transferred to me 9 minutes into the call), does it really take that long just to take care of this very simple issue?~~Customer calls because he has an issue with our company. He demands to speak to a supervisor. I go to my supervisor, she asks me what type of account he has. She tells me that he should be talking to a different department. I tell him that he is speaking to the wrong department. He needs to go to the other department. He refuses.~~I work in a restaurant. When a customer has a complaint, I usually just get the manager or supervisor right away. I don't feel comfortable trying to de-escalate the situation. I usually just want to get the manager to deal with it. But I feel like I shouldn't do that. Any tips on handling complaints?~~I work in a call center. Our policy is that managers will never take the call off you unless hell freezes over. It's either that or the customer is given the option of a callback within 48 hours. Most of the time they refuse the callback and just want to speak to a manager right now. If they agree to take the call it's almost guaranteed that if you keep the account open and check for interactions they won't have done it. Our escalation process is a pain in the ass.~~Customer is angry about a missing order. He wants to talk to the manager. The manager is not available at the moment. The supervisor posts the higher manager needs to handle the issue. The higher manager needs to handle the issue in all caps and bold letters at least five times. The supervisor never calls the customer.~~Me and my supervisor were helping this guy make a payment over the phone. He was having trouble logging in and was getting very frustrated. He failed the quiz we have for customers to login. He didn't like the fact that we needed more information from him to help him make a payment.

The building was put on lockdown and everyone was evacuated. I wasn't there at the time, but I came in the next day and only found out about it through a vague email. The person called back in on Thursday, and then again today. The whole building went on lockdown again today, and it was terrifying. The managers had no idea what was going on. They finally lifted the lockdown and said we could leave if we didn't feel safe, so I got the hell out of there. I really don't want to go back to work tomorrow.~~I work in a call center. I answer the phone. It's my job. I have had a few infuriating calls. people just assume I am superslow because I happen to answer this phone as my job. They make that clear by speaking slowly, repeating things I've just confirmed (so here is my bank account number so you can make sure you wrote that down correctly okay. 1......2......3... so tha's 1 2 3 right? then 4... got that?) or assuming I'm really dumb and forgot what I've just told them or that I am plain wrong. I've also had people ask straight for my supervisor because they assumed I wouldn't be able to help them.~~I work in a call center. Today I got chewed out for not being empathetic enough on a call. I tried explaining that the customer was being rude and uncooperative. My supervisor told me that I need to take responsibility for the call and that there is never an excuse for being rude. I got scored low on ""empathy"" even though the customer was being rude and uncooperative. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm being set up to fail.~~I work in a call center. It's a large company and there are several call centers. I work in one of the smaller ones. There are about 50 of us in my center. We take calls from all over the country. Most of the calls are simple questions that we can answer right away. Some of the calls are more difficult and require some research. We have a team of people who take these calls. There are about 10 of us on the team. We each take turns answering the more difficult calls.~~A member of the public is unhappy about the service he has received and wants to speak to a manager. The customer support agent tells him that she is the highest point of contact and her decision is final. The customer becomes angry and threatens the agent. The agent ends the call. Was the agent right to do this?","Impatient, yet wastes time complaining~~Cst Calling wrong department demands supervisor.~~How do you deal with De-escalating?~~Escalation processes~~What I hate most my job...~~The type of customer who thinks and acts like they know more than you and is rude about it are the worse.~~Shooter threat~~How come people assume call center employees are slow/dumb/worthless?~~Probably getting a CA because I didn't apologize for 45 minutes of technical issues.~~Don't Feed Stray Cats~~Short and sweet. I air grabbed.","I work as a contractor for a very well known phone company. I just recently started taking escalated calls, where a customer asks to speak with a manager or supervisor. I just had one today, and I am still baffled. I was on the phone with this customer for about 20 minutes, and he was just getting more and more angry. I tried to explain to him that he was speaking to the wrong department, and that he needed to go to the other department. He refused. I went to my supervisor, and she told me to transfer him again. I did, and he got even more angry. He was swearing at me the entire time. I went to my supervisor again, and she told me to transfer him again. I did, and he was still swearing at me. I went to my supervisor one last time, and she told me to just hang up on him. I did, and he continued to swear at me. I was so confused. I don't understand why he was so angry. I was just doing my job.",55,19_supervisor_manager_escalated_get, theme of this text customer service
