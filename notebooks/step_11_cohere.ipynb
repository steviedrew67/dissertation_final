Part of my job duties involved calling people to go over what their insurance policies would cover in regards to surgical procedures, treatments, visits, and sometimes medications. The annoying issues I ran into were cases of parents of adult children living at home demanding that I tell them the purpose of the call for their adult children and I had to explain that I could only speak to their adult children and then there were the spouses of patients who demanded the same thing. I found often there are a good amount of people who didn\\'t seem to understand or even know about the existence of HIPAA laws. Here\\'s one of those tales.\\n\\nMe-Billing Agent (BA)\\n\\nAnnoying Wife of Patient-AWP\\n\\nAdditional info-Patient was scheduled for an upcoming surgery and no HIPAA authorizations were on his file.\\n\\nI call the home- \\\"Hello, this is BA from Such and Such Health Insurance company, may I speak with John Doe?\\\"\\n\\nAWP- He\\'s out in the garage, I\\'m his wife.\\\"\\n\\nBA- \\\"Is he available to speak with me? Or can I arrange a call back?\\\"\\n\\nAWP-\\\"I filled out his paperwork and you can speak to me\\\".\\n\\nBA-\\\"M\\'aam\\\" I can only speak with him\\\".\\n\\nAWP- \\\"Like I said I filled out his paperwork and you speak to me\\\".\\n\\nI then again tell her that I can only speak to him. I set up the callback. Called several hours later and spoke to the patient. I could hear the wife in the background butting in with the answers and such.\\n\\nAfter that encounter and similar encounters on that job I made the vow that if I ever got married I wouldn\\'t butt into things or situations that my wife can handle on her own given that she has the ability to speak on her own behalf. Yes, there are situations that warrant medical POAs and HIPAA authorization involvement because of things like dementia, brain injuries, issues communicating due to stroke, illness, etc. If a person is able to speak on their own behalf and they have all their faculties in tact, then they should do so and spouses or other family members need to respect that and not butt in or make demands of people working for insurance companies, hospital billing etc.\\n\\nAdditional note-Another memorable incident on that job involved a 19 year old male. His mother answered the phone number on file and kept ranting \\\"I\\'m his mother you can talk to me\\\". I laughed after that call because I lived at home due to finances and to help my parents with my grandmother until I was 21. But, my parents never butted into my business regarding insurance, my job, and other things. Years later, when I worked in billing it made me glad that my parents aren\\'t nosy assholes.',\n",
