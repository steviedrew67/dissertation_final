The notebooks and rmarkdown files in this repository were used to generate the following report: https://github.com/steviedrew67/dissertation_final/blob/main/rmarkdown/openai_summarization_report.pdf.

This code is associated with my doctoral dissertation for DePaul University.  The dissertation is pending defense and will be uploaded here upon successful defense.  

The draft limitations section is included here: 
https://github.com/steviedrew67/dissertation_final/blob/main/other/limitations.pdf

To replicate, decompress the talesfromcallcenters_submissions.zst and talesfromcallcenters_comments.zst and re-name as ndjson files.  Place these files in the same directory as the notebooks and start with https://github.com/steviedrew67/dissertation_final/blob/main/notebooks/step_1.ipynb

API keys from OpenAI and Cohere are required. It is possible to run start to finish with OpenAI only but some code in step_10 and step_12 will need to be modified as these files measure accuracy for all three models.

For other example outputs from this process see:
